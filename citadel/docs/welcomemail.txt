  Welcome to your new Citadel installation!

   Congratulations! You've now completed your Citadel Installation.
   Your Citadel system provides you with the following Protocols to
   communicate with your Client Software:

     * Webmail via http and https. Any remaining configuration Tasks, are
       most likely able to be completed in Webcit
     * IMAP Directory Services. Access your Inbox and other Rooms easily via
       IMAP.
     * POP3 Mail Delivery. If you'd like to poll mails over to your Client,
       use POP3.
     * [1]GroupDAV Calendaring and Address book Access. Connect your
       Calendaring Client to a central Storage, and share calendars with
       others.
     * iCalendar-over-WebDAV ("Webcal") Access to your personal Calendar.
     * SMTP / MSA access with TLS support. Receive mails from others or relay
       your own Client via your Citadel.

   For advice regarding how to configure your favorite Mail client to
   interact with Citadel, please see the [2]Client Matrix . If you don't find
   your client there, please sign into [3]Uncensored! and tell us about it in
   the Citadel Documentation Room! And if you would like to provide
   screenshots on how you did the configuration for documentation purposes,
   we'll appreciate them.

   Please see the [4]FAQ for more general questions, or the [5]Citadel
   Administration Manual for more involved situations. Or, join us at
   [6]Uncensored!, post your message into the Citadel Support Room and you
   will get help there. You may also join us on [7]IRC (irc.citadel.org, or
   freenode network) in #Citadel.

   If Webcit does not yet speak your language, please tell us at
   [8]Uncensored! in the Citadel Development Room, where you will be welcomed
   and encouraged to add a translation Working contributions in various forms
   are always welcome, in fact, so feel free to join us in improving the
   Citadel system!
