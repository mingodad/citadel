<h3>Welcome to your new Citadel installation! </h3>

Congratulations! You've now completed your Citadel Installation.<br>
Your Citadel system provides
you with the following Protocols to communicate with your Client Software: 

<ul>
 <li>Webmail via http and https. Any remaining configuration
     Tasks, are most likely able to be completed in Webcit</li>
 <li>IMAP Directory Services. Access your Inbox and other Rooms easily
     via IMAP. </li>
 <li>POP3 Mail Delivery. If you'd like to poll mails over to your
     Client, use Pop3.</li>
 <li><a href="http://www.groupdav.org">GroupDAV</a>
     Calendaring and Address book Access. Connect your Calendaring Client to a
     central Storage, and share calendars with others.</li>
 <li>ICal Access to your personal Calendar.</li>
 <li>SMTP / MSA access with TLS support. Receive mails from others or
     relay your own Client via your Citadel.</li>
</ul>

<br>
