<p> Version 2, June 1991 </p>
<pre>Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  <br>59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA<br><br>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br></pre>
<h3 align="justify">Preamble</h3>
<div align="justify"> </div>
<p align="justify"> The licenses for most software are designed to take
away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General
Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and
change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its
users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to
your programs, too. </p>
<div align="justify"> </div>
<p align="justify"> When we speak of free software, we are referring to
freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make
sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software
(and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code
or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use
pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these
things. </p>
<div align="justify"> </div>
<p align="justify"> To protect your rights, we need to make
restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you
to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain
responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or
if you modify it. </p>
<div align="justify"> </div>
<p align="justify"> For example, if you distribute copies of such a
program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all
the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or
can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights. </p>
<div align="justify"> </div>
<p align="justify"> We protect your rights with two steps: (1)
copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you
legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software. </p>
<div align="justify"> </div>
<p align="justify"> Also, for each author's protection and ours, we
want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no
warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone
else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have
is not
the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not
reflect
on the original authors' reputations. </p>
<div align="justify"> </div>
<p align="justify"> Finally, any free program is threatened constantly
by
software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a
free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program
proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent
must
be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all. </p>
<div align="justify"> </div>
<p align="justify"> The precise terms and conditions for copying,
distribution and modification follow. </p>
<div align="justify"> </div>
<h3>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</h3>
<div align="justify"> </div>
<p align="justify"> <strong>0.</strong> This License applies to any
program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright
holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General
Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or
work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing
the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications
and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee
is addressed as "you". </p>
<p align="justify"> Activities other than copying, distribution and
modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its
scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output
from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work
based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the
Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does. </p>
<p align="justify"> <strong>1.</strong> You may copy and distribute
verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any
medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on
each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty;
keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the
absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a
copy of this License along with the Program. </p>
<p align="justify"> You may charge a fee for the physical act of
transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty
protection in exchange for a fee. </p>
<p align="justify"> <strong>2.</strong> You may modify your copy or
copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based
on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work
under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of
these conditions: </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<div align="justify">
<ul>
  <li><strong>a)</strong> You must cause the modified files to carry
prominent notices stating that you changed the files
and the date of any change.
    <p> </p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>b)</strong> You must cause any work that you distribute
or publish, that in whole or in part contains
or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed
as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this
License.
    <p> </p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>c)</strong> If the modified program normally reads
commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started
running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or
display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally
print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not
required to print an announcement.) </li>
</ul>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire
whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. </div>
<p align="justify"> Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim
rights
or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
intent
is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective
works based on the Program. </p>
<p align="justify"> In addition, mere aggregation of another work not
based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the
Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring
the other work under the scope of this License. </p>
<p align="justify"> <strong>3.</strong> You may copy and distribute
the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or
executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that
you also do one of the following:<!-- we use this doubled UL to get the sub-sections indented, --><!-- while making the bullets as unobvious as possible. -->
</p>
<div align="justify">
<ul>
  <li><strong>a)</strong> Accompany it with the complete corresponding
machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms
of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software
interchange; or,
    <p> </p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>b)</strong> Accompany it with a written offer, valid for
at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more
than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,
    <p> </p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>c)</strong> Accompany it with the information you
received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This
alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if
you received the program in object code or executable form with such an
offer, in accord with Subsection b above.) </li>
</ul>
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that
is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the
major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system
on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable. </div>
<p align="justify"> If distribution of executable or object code is
made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering
equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to
copy the source along with the object code. </p>
<p align="justify"> <strong>4.</strong> You may not copy, modify,
sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided
under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense
or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate
your rights under this License. However, parties who have received
copies, or rights, from
you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long
as such parties remain in full compliance. </p>
<p align="justify"> <strong>5.</strong> You are not required to accept
this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else
grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its
derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not
accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the
Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your
acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions
for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on
it. </p>
<p align="justify"> <strong>6.</strong> Each time you redistribute the
Program
(or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically
receives a
license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the
Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any
further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted
herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third
parties to this License. </p>
<p align="justify"> <strong>7.</strong> If, as a consequence of a
court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other
reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you
(whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the
conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions
of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other
pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit
royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive
copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could
satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
distribution of the Program. </p>
<p align="justify"> If any portion of this section is held invalid or
unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the
section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to
apply in other circumstances. </p>
<p align="justify"> It is not the purpose of this section to induce you
to
infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest
validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of
protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system,
which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice. </p>
<p align="justify"> This section is intended to make thoroughly clear
what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License. </p>
<p align="justify"> <strong>8.</strong> If the distribution and/or use
of
the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by
copyrighted
interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under
this
License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries
not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
limitation
as if written in the body of this License. </p>
<p align="justify"> <strong>9.</strong> The Free Software Foundation
may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License
from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the
present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or
concerns. </p>
<p align="justify"> Each version is given a distinguishing version
number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which
applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following
the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not
specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version
ever published by
the Free Software Foundation. </p>
<p align="justify"> <strong>10.</strong> If you wish to incorporate
parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution
conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission.
For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,
write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for
this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the
free status of all
derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse
of software generally. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>NO WARRANTY</strong></p>
<div align="justify"> </div>
<p align="justify"> <strong>11.</strong> BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS
LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN
WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM
"AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK
AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD
THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. </p>
<p align="justify"> <strong>12.</strong> IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED
BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR
ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS
PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY
TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES
OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN
IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH
DAMAGES. </p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Citadel is an advanced, multiuser, client/server messaging system
suitable for BBS, e-mail, and groupware applications. It is designed to
handle the needs of both small dialup systems and large-scale
Internet-connected systems. It was originally developed on an Altos
system running Xenix, and has been installed and tested on various Unix
and Unix-like platforms. The current development environment (and
public BBS) is an ordinary Linux system. The current distribution
includes: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The Citadel server (this is the back end that does all
processing) </li>
  <li>A text-based client program designed with the traditional Citadel
"look and feel" (room prompts, dot commands, and the like) </li>
  <li>Setup programs </li>
  <li>A set of utilities for system administration and maintenance </li>
  <li>Documentation </li>
</ul>
<p>Some knowledge of the Unix system is necessary to install and manage
the system. It is mandatory that the sysop have "root" access to the
operating system. The following are required to install Citadel: </p>
<ul>

<p>If you are running Citadel on a Linux system, it is STRONGLY
recommended that you run it on a recent distribution (such as Fedora
Core 3 or newer). A new-ish
distribution will have most or all of the prerequisite tools and
libraries already integrated for you.</p>
<h3>Other pieces which complete the Citadel system:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>"WebCit", a gateway program to allow full access to Citadel via
the World Wide Web. Interactive access through any Web browser. </li>
  <li>Access to Citadel via <i>any</i> standards-compliant e-mail
program, thanks to Citadel's built-in SMTP, POP, and IMAP services.
You can use Mozilla, Netscape, Evolution, Eudora, Pine, Outlook, etc.
with Citadel.</li>
  <li>Access to Citadel's calendar and address book functions using any
GroupDAV-enabled PIM client (requires WebCit).<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Coming soon:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>More integration with third-party software.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="Everything_in_its_place..."></a>Everything in its place...</h3>
<p>Hopefully you've unpacked the distribution archive into its own
directory. This is the directory in which all Citadel files are located
and in
which all activity will take place. Several subdirectories have already
been created during the unpacking process, and others may be created
by the software if needed. Make sure you have Berkeley DB installed on
your system, and that you have all the development libraries and
headers
in place so that you can compile against them. If you don't, you can
get the latest Berkeley DB at <a href="http://www.sleepycat.com">http://www.sleepycat.com</a>.
If your operating system uses a separate library to support POSIX
threads (pthreads), make sure that library is installed as well. This
is almost never the case with Linux, but some commercial Unix flavors
might need it.<br>
<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="ctdl_login_acct"></a>Creating a system account for Citadel</h3>
<p>As with many Unix programs, Citadel wants to run under its own user
ID. Unlike other programs, however, this user ID will do double-duty as
a public login for your system if you are running a BBS. This account
is typically called "bbs" or "citadel" or something to that effect. You
will tell Citadel what the user-id of that account is, and when someone
logs in under that account, Citadel will prompt for a user name.</p>
<p>The Citadel user should have a unique uid. The home directory should
be the one your Citadel installation resides in (in this example we
will use <tt>/usr/local/citadel</tt>) and the shell should be either
"citadel" in
that directory, or a script that will start up the citadel client.
Example:</p>
<pre>citadel::100:1:Citadel Login:/usr/local/citadel:/usr/local/citadel/citadel<br></pre>
<p>When you run setup later, you will be required to tell it the
username or user ID of the account you created is, so it knows what
user to run as. If you create an account called <tt>citadel, bbs</tt>,
or <tt>guest</tt>, the setup program will automatically pick up the
user ID by default.</p>
<p>For all other users in /etc/passwd (or in some other name service
such as NIS), Citadel will automatically set up
an account using the full name (or 'gecos' in Unixspeak) of the user.
It'll also ignore any password you supply, because it uses the user's
password
on the host system. This allows a 'single sign on' type of environment.
Note that this does have to be enabled at compile time -- it's the
configure
option called <tt>--enable-autologin</tt>. Keep in mind that these
users
can use *either* their Citadel login name or their login name on the
host
computer, and their password on the host computer.<br>
<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="bypassing_login"></a>Bypassing the <tt>login:</tt>
prompt</h3>
<p>If you normally log in to your host system using some method other
than telnet (such as ssh), you might want the telnet service to go
straight into Citadel, instead of displaying the <tt>login:</tt>
prompt first. You
can do this by having telnetd start citadel directly instead of
<tt>/bin/login</tt>. The <tt>setup</tt> program will offer to
configure
this automatically for you if it sees a configuration it understands.
If you would prefer to configure it manually, all you need to do is
make a
simple change to your <tt>inetd</tt> or <tt>xinetd</tt>
configuration. Here are some configuration examples.</p>
<p>An example for <tt>inetd</tt> (put the following line in <tt>/etc/inetd.conf</tt>,
replacing any existing telnet configuration line already there):</p>
<pre>telnet stream tcp nowait root /usr/sbin/tcpd in.telnetd -L /usr/local/citadel/citadel<br></pre>
<p>An example for <tt>xinetd</tt> (if you have a file called <tt>/etc/xinetd.d/telnet</tt>
then simply replace that file with this one):</p>
<pre>service telnet<br>{<br>	flags           = REUSE<br>	socket_type     = stream<br>	wait            = no<br>	user            = root<br>	server          = /usr/sbin/in.telnetd<br>	server_args     = -L /usr/local/citadel/citadel<br>	log_on_failure  += USERID<br>	disable         = no<br>}<br></pre>
<p>Please make sure you know what you're doing before you install this!
If
you are going to put Citadel somewhere other than <tt>/usr/local/citadel</tt>
then change the directory name accordingly. If you know of any other
local peculiarities which need to be observed, edit the above
configuration
accordingly as well. And, of course, if you're working remotely, make
sure you can successfully log in using SSH <b>before</b> you start
making
changes to telnet, because if you accidentally break telnet and don't
have
SSH running, you'll have effectively locked yourself out of your system
until you can get physical access to the console.<br>
<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="Compiling_the_programs"></a>Compiling the programs</h3>
<p>You can easily compile the Citadel system with the following
commands:</p>
<pre>./configure<br>make<br>make install<br></pre>
<p>The 'configure' script will generate a Makefile from the
Makefile.in,
and it will also write the file "sysdep.h" to your Citadel directory.
Please do not edit sysdep.h or Makefile.in yourself. The configure
script will
figure out your system dependencies and set everything correctly.</p>
<p>Mac OS X 10.1 and later are now supported. (Sorry, 10.0 cannot be
supported, now or in the future.) You need to install the Developer
Tools CD, which you can purchase or download for free from <a
 href="http://developer.apple.com">http://developer.apple.com</a>. Then
run configure like this:</p>
<pre>env CC=/usr/bin/cc ./configure (options - see below)<br></pre>
<p>By default, the Citadel system will install in <tt>/usr/local/citadel</tt>.
If you wish to place it in a different directory, you can instead do:</p>
<pre>./configure --prefix=/export/home/citadel      (or whatever)<br></pre>
<p>If you've got Berkeley DB installed in a non-standard location, you
can help the configure script find it by doing something like this:</p>
<pre>./configure --with-db=/usr/local/BerkeleyDB-4.1<br></pre>
<p>Keep in mind that if you're using Berkeley DB from a non-standard
location,
you'll have to make sure that location is available at runtime.</p>
<p>File permissions are always a bother to work with. You don't want
Citadel to crash because someone couldn't access a file, but you also
don't want shell users peeking into the binaries to do things like
reading others' mail, finding private rooms, etc. The Citadel server
needs to be started as root in order to bind to privileged ports, but
as soon as its initialization is finished, it changes its user ID to
your Citadel user in order to avoid security holes.</p>
<h3><a name="Upgrading"></a>Upgrading</h3>
<p>Any existing Citadel installation which is at version 5.50 or newer
may be upgraded in place without the need to discard your existing data
files.</p>
<p>Upgrading to a new version uses the same build procedure as
compiling
the program for a fresh install, except that you want to do <tt>make
upgrade</tt> instead of <tt>make install</tt>. This will
overwrite the programs but not your data. <b>Be sure to shut down
citserver during this process!</b> If Citadel is running while you
upgrade, you may face data corruption issues.<br>
</p>
<p>After doing <tt>make upgrade</tt>, you should run <tt>setup</tt>
again to bring your data files up to date. Please see the setup section
below for more information on this.</p>
<h3><a name="rc_file"></a>The <tt>citadel.rc</tt> file</h3>
<p>The text-based client included with Citadel is suitable for BBS
applications. Much of its command set and other behavior is
configurable through a Run Control (RC) file. The standard client looks
for this file in the following locations: </p>
<ul>
  <li><tt>$HOME/.citadelrc</tt></li>
  <li><i>your-Citadel-directory</i><tt>/citadel.rc</tt></li>
  <li><tt>/etc/citadel.rc</tt></li>
  <li><i>current-directory</i><tt>/citadel.rc</tt></li>
</ul>
The next couple of sections deal with client-side configuration.
<h3><a name="Using_an_external_editor_for_message"></a>Using an
external editor
for message composition</h3>
<p>Citadel has a built-in message editor. However, you can also use
your favorite text editor to write messages. To do this you simply put
a line in your citadel.rc file like this:</p>
<pre>editor=/usr/bin/vi<br></pre>
<p>The above example would make Citadel call the vi editor when using
the <tt><b>.E</b>nter <b>E</b>ditor</tt> command. You can also make
it the default editor for the <tt><b>E</b>nter</tt> command by editing
the <tt>citadel.rc</tt> file. <b>But be warned:</b> external editors
on public systems can
be a security hole, because they usually provide users with the ability
to drop into a shell on the host system, or save files using names
other
than the name of the temporary file they are editing. If you intend to
use an external editor on a public BBS, make sure you use one that has
been
hardened for such a purpose -- one which has had the 'shell' and 'save
as'
commands disabled, as well as any other functions which a destructive
user could use to gain unauthorized access to your host system.</p>
<h3><a name="Printing_messages"></a>Printing messages</h3>
<p>Citadel can send messages to a printer, or just about anywhere
else in your system. The variable <tt>PRINTCMD</tt> in <tt>citadel.rc</tt>
specifies what command you use to print. Text is sent to the standard
input (stdin) of the print command.</p>
<p>So if you did this:</p>
<pre>printcmd="a2ps -o - |lpr -Plocal"<br></pre>
<p>...that would convert the printed text to PostScript, then print on
the
printer named "local". There's tons of stuff you can do with this
feature. For example, you could use a command like <tt>cat
&lt;&lt;$HOME/archive</tt> to save copies of important messages in a
textfile. Again, this is probably something you don't want to configure
for a public BBS host -- most system administrators don't want remote
users sending arbitrary things to local printers.</p>
<h3><a name="URL_viewing"></a>URL viewing</h3>
<p>This is one more feature which is appropriate for local users. While
reading
a message that has Internet URL's in it, you can select the <tt><b>U</b>RL-view</tt>
command, and it will perform some pre-defined action (usually, this is
to open up the URL in a web browser). For example:</p>
<pre>urlcmd=netscape -remote "openURL(%s)"<br></pre>
<p>In the above example, it would open up the URL in an open <a
 href="http://www.netscape.com/download">Netscape</a> window.<br>
<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="Setup_and_login"></a>Setup and login</h3>
<p>Before logging in for the first time, you must run the setup
program. To begin this procedure, enter the following commands:</p>
<pre>cd /usr/local/citadel<br>./setup<br></pre>
<p>The setup program will guide you through a simple configuration
procedure. It will ask you what directory to place your data files in
-- the default is the current directory, which is usually the sensible
thing to select. If you want to run more than one instance of Citadel
on the same host, however, you can specify a different directory here
-- just remember to specify the directory name again when you start up
the server later on.</p>
<p><tt>setup</tt> will then shut down the Citadel service if it is
found to
be running.</p>
<p>You will then be prompted for the name of the system administrator.
This is not merely a cosmetic option -- when you log in to your system
a little while from now, you'll log in with this name, and it will
automatically assign your account the highest access level.</p>
<p>Next, you will be prompted for the User ID of the Citadel account on
your host system. If you have an account called <tt>bbs</tt>, <tt>guest</tt>,
or <tt>citadel</tt>, that account's UID will be the default. If you
are upgrading or reconfiguring an existing system, the existing value
will be preserved.</p>
<p>Then you will be prompted for a server port number. This is the TCP
port which Citadel clients use to connect to your Citadel server. In
almost all cases, you want to use the default -- port 504, which is the
official port number assigned by the IANA for Citadel implementations.</p>
<p>The Citadel service will then be started, and you will see the
following message:</p>
<pre>Setup is finished.  You may now log in.<br></pre>
<p>Setup is now complete, on most systems, anyway. Please see below to
find out if you need to do anything else:</p>
<h3><a name="Configuring_your_host_system_to_start"></a>Configuring
your host
system to start the service</h3>
<p><b>Please note:</b> this topic involves modifications made to <tt>/etc/services</tt>
and <tt>/etc/inittab</tt> in order to configure your host system to
automatically start the Citadel service. <tt>setup</tt> will
automatically perform these steps if it can, and if you allow it to --
just answer 'Yes' when prompted, and everything will be taken care of
for you. If you answer 'No' -- or if your system is a little bit odd
(for example, BSD systems don't have <tt>/etc/inittab</tt>) -- read
this section and do what you need to in order to get things configured.</p>
<p>Before you can use Citadel, you must define the "citadel" service to
your system. This is accomplished by adding a line to your
/etc/services file that looks something like this:</p>
<pre>citadel		504/tcp			# Citadel Server<br></pre>
<p>504 is the port number officially designated by the IANA for use by
Citadel. There should not be any need to use a different port number,
unless you are running multiple Citadels on the same computer and
therefore need
a different port for each one.</p>
<p>The next step is to arrange for the server to start. The <tt>citserver</tt>
program is the main Citadel server. Before we cover the recommended
method of starting the server, let's examine its usage options:</p>
<pre>citserver [-hHomeDir] [-xDebugLevel] [-tTraceFile] [-lLogFacility] [-d] [-f]<br></pre>
<p>The options are as follows:</p>
<p><tt>-hHomeDir</tt> - the directory your Citadel data files live in.
This should, of course, be a directory that you've run the <tt>setup</tt>
program against to set up some data files. If a directory is not
specified, the directory
name which was specified in the <tt>Makefile</tt> will be used.</p>
<p><tt>-xDebugLevel</tt> - Set the verbosity of trace messages printed.
When -x is used, it will suppress messages sent to syslog (see below).
In
other words, syslog will never see certain messages if -x is used.
Normally
you should configure logging through syslog, but -x may still be useful
in
some circumstances. The available debugging levels are: </p>
<ul>
  <li>0 - Emergency condition; Citadel will exit immediately </li>
  <li>1 - Severe errors; Citadel may be unable to continue without
attention </li>
  <li>2 - Critical errors; Citadel will continue with degraded
functionality </li>
  <li>3 - Error conditions; Citadel will recover and continue normally </li>
  <li>4 - Warning messages; Citadel will continue normally </li>
  <li>5 - Normal operational messages </li>
  <li>6 - Informational messages, progress reports, etc. </li>
  <li>7 - Debugging messages; extremely verbose </li>
</ul>
<p><tt>-tTraceFile</tt> - Tell the server where to send its debug/trace
output. Normally it is sent to stdout.</p>
<p><tt>-lLogFacility</tt> - Tell the server to send its debug/trace
output
to the <tt>syslog</tt> service on the host system <i>instead of</i>
to a
trace file. <tt>LogFacility</tt> must be one of: <tt><i>kern, user,
mail,
daemon, auth, syslog, lpr, news, uucp, local0, local1, local2, local3,
local4, local5, local6, local7</i></tt>. Please note that use of the
<tt>-l</tt> option will cancel any use of the <tt>-t</tt> option; that
is,
if you specify a trace file <i>and</i> a syslog facility, log output
will
only go to the syslog facility.
</p>
<p><tt>-d</tt> - Run as a daemon; i.e. in the background. This switch
would be necessary if you were starting the Citadel server, for
example, from an rc.local script (which is not recommended, because
this won't allow the server to automatically restart when it is shut
down).</p>
<p><tt>-f</tt> - Defragment all the databases upon startup. &nbsp; This
currently has no effect, as it is a vestige from the old data store.</p>
<p>The preferred method of starting the Citadel server is to place an
entry in your /etc/inittab file. This will conveniently bring the
server up when your system is up, and terminate it gracefully when your
system is shutting down. The exact syntax for your system may vary, but
here's an entry that could be used on a Linux system:</p>
<pre>cit:2345:respawn:/usr/local/citadel/citserver -h/usr/local/citadel -t/dev/tty9 -x6<br></pre>
<p>In this example, we've chosen debugging level 6, and have the trace
stuff output to one of the virtual consoles. It's important to remember
to turn off any getty that is set up on that virtual console, if you do
this. After making this change, the command <tt>init q</tt> works on
most systems to tell init to re-read the file. If in doubt, just reboot
the computer.<br>
<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="first_time_login"></a>Logging in for the
first time</h3>
<p>At this point, your system is ready to run. Run the <tt>citadel</tt>
program from the shell and log in as a new user. NOTE: the first user
account to be created will automatically be set to access level 6
(Aide). This overcomes some obvious logistical problems - normally,
Aide access is given by another Aide, but since there aren't any on
your system yet, this isn't possible.<br>
<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="Welcoming_new_users"></a>Welcoming new users</h3>
<p>Sometimes you might decide that you want a welcome message (or
several different messages) automatically mailed to new users upon
their first login. Now there is a way to do this. If you create a room
called <tt>New User Greetings</tt>, and it is a <i>private</i> room
(invitation-only probably makes the most sense), any messages you enter
into that room will automatically be delivered to all new users upon
registration.</p>
<p>You can put anything you want there: a welcome message, system
policies, special information, etc. You can also put as many messages
there as you want to (although it really doesn't make sense to clutter
new users' mailboxes with lots of junk).</p>
<p>Don't worry about wasting disk space, either. Citadel has a
single-instance message store, so all the new users are actually
looking at the same copy of the message on disk.<br>
<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="adding_doors"></a>Space for adding
your own
client features (doors)</h3>
<p><b>Please take note!</b> This function really represents the "old"
way of doing things, and it doesn't fit in well with the client/server
paradigm. Please consider it "deprecated" because it may be removed
someday.</p>
<p>The "doorway" feature is just a generic way to add features to the
system. It is called "Doorway" to make it resemble the doors on
non-Unix boards, but as we all know, us Unix types don't have to write
special code to access the modem. :-) Anyway, when a user hits the <tt><b>*</b></tt>
(doorway) command, Citadel does...</p>
<pre>USERNAME=(username); export USERNAME<br>./subsystem (user-number) (screen-width) (access level)<br></pre>
<p>...so you can put whatever you want in there. I suggest putting in a
menu
program to allow the users to pick one of a number of programs, etc. Do
be aware that door programs will only be available when the client and
server
programs are running on the <i>same</i> computer, and when the user is
running
the text-mode client. Because of these restrictions, Door programs are
being
utilized less and less every day.<br>
<br>

<h3><a name="Troubleshooting_and_getting_help"></a>Troubleshooting and
getting help</h3>
<p>That's just about all the information you need to install the
system. But if you get stuck, you can visit <a
 href="http://uncensored.citadel.org">UNCENSORED! BBS</a> and report a
problem or ask for help. But if you intend to report a problem getting
the Citadel server to run, <i>please</i> double-check the following
things first: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Did you do <tt>./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make
install</tt> ?? </li>
  <li>Did you run setup? </li>
  <li>Did you start the server? </li>
</ul>
<p>To report a problem, you can log on to <a
 href="http://uncensored.citadel.org">UNCENSORED!</a> or any other BBS
on the Citadel network which carries the <tt>Citadel/UX&gt;</tt> room.
Please DO NOT e-mail the developers directly. Post a request for help
on the BBS, with all of the following information: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The exact nature of your difficulty </li>
  <li>A transcript of the error message(s) if possible </li>
  <li>The version of Citadel you are running </li>
  <li>The version of Berkeley DB present on your system </li>
  <li>Which operating system you are running, and what version </li>
  <li>If you are running a Linux system, we need to know which
distribution, and the version of the kernel, libc, and pthreads you
are using (it would help to post the output of a <tt>ldd ./citserver</tt>

<h3><a name="Overview_"></a>Overview</h3>
<p>Citadel, when installed properly, will do most of its maintenance
by itself. It is intended to be run unattended for extended periods of
time, and most installations do just that without any software failures.</p>
<p>The system has seven access levels. Most users are at the bottom and
have
no special privileges. Aides are selected people who have special
access within
the Citadel program. Room Aides only have this access in a certain
room. Preferred users can be selected by Aides for access to preferred
only rooms. A sysop is anyone who has access to the various sysop
utilities - these
are in their own executable files, which should have their permissions
set
to allow only sysops to run them. You should either create a sysops
group
in /etc/group, or use some other existing group for this purpose.</p>
<p>Aides have access to EVERY room on the system, public and private
(all types). They also have access to commands starting with <tt>.<b>A</b>ide</tt>
in addition to being able to delete and move messages. The system room,
<tt>Aide&gt;</tt>, is accessible only by those users designated as
Aides.</p>
<h3><a name="Aide_commands"></a>Aide commands</h3>
<p>Aides have the following commands available to them that are not

<h3><a name="Editing_rooms"></a>Editing rooms</h3>
<p>This command allows any aide to change the parameters of a room. Go
to the room you wish to edit and enter the <tt><b>.A</b>ide <b>E</b>dit
room</tt> command. A series of prompts will be displayed. The existing
parameters will be displayed in brackets; simply press return if you
want
to leave any or all of them unchanged.</p>
<pre> <br>Room name [IG's Fun Room]:<br></pre>
<p>...the name of the room.</p>
<pre>Private room [Yes]? <br></pre>
<p>...enter Yes if you wish to restrict access to the room, or no if
the room
is to be accessible by all users. Note that Citadel doesn't bother
users
about access to rooms every time they need to access the room. Once a
user
gains access to a private room, it then behaves like a public room to
them.
The following four questions will only be asked if you selected
Private...</p>
<pre>Accessible by guessing room name [No]?<br></pre>
<p>...if you enter Yes, the room will not show up in users' <tt><b>K</b>nown
rooms</tt> listing, but if they <tt><b>.G</b>oto</tt> the room (typing
the room's full name), they will gain access to the room.</p>
<pre>Accessible by entering a password [No]?<br>Room password [mypasswd]:  <br></pre>
<p>...this adds an additional layer of security to the room, prompting
users for a password before they can gain access to the room.</p>
<p>If you did not select guessname or passworded, then the only way
users can access the room is if an Aide explicitly invites them to the
room using the <tt><b>.A</b>ide <b>R</b>oom <b>I</b>nvite user</tt>
command.</p>
<pre>Cause current users to forget room [No] ? No<br></pre>
<p>Enter Yes if you wish to kick out anyone who currently has access to
the room.</p>
<pre>Preferred users only [No]? No<br></pre>
<p>Enter Yes if you wish to restrict the room to only users who have
level 5 (Preferred User) status (and Aides too, of course). You should
make the room public if you intend to do this, otherwise the two
restrictions will be COMBINED.</p>
<pre>Read-only room [No]? No<br></pre>
<p>If you set a room to Read-Only, then normal users will not be
allowed to
post messages in it. Messages may only be posted by Aides, and by
utility programs such as the networker and the "aidepost" utility. This
is
useful in situations where a room is used exclusively for important
announcements, or if you've set up a room to receive an Internet
mailing
list and posting wouldn't make sense. Other uses will, of course,
become
apparent as the need arises.</p>
<p>Now for a few other attributes...</p>
<pre>Directory room [Yes]? Yes<br></pre>
<p>...enter Yes if you wish to associate a directory with this room.
This can be used as a small file repository for files relevant to the
topic of the room. If you enter Yes, you will also be prompted with the
following four questions:</p>
<pre>Directory name [mydirname]: <br></pre>
<p>...the name of the subdirectory to put this room's files in. The
name of the directory created will be <tt><i>&lt;your Citadel
directory&gt;</i>/files/<i>&lt;room dir name&gt;</i></tt>.</p>
<pre>Uploading allowed [Yes]? Yes<br></pre>
<p>...enter Yes if users are allowed to upload to this room.</p>
<pre>Downloading allowed [Yes]? Yes<br></pre>
<p>...enter Yes if users are allowed to download from this room.</p>
<pre>Visible directory [Yes]? Yes<br></pre>
<p>...enter Yes if users can read the directory of this room.</p>
<pre>Network shared room [No]? No<br></pre>
<p>...you can share a room over a network without setting this flag,
and
vice versa, but what this flag does is twofold: </p>
<ul>
  <li>It prevents people with no network access from entering messages
here </li>
  <li>Messages are displayed with the name of their originating
system in the header. </li>
</ul>
<pre>Permanent room [No]? No<br></pre>
<p>Citadel contains an 'auto purger' which is capable of removing rooms
which have not been posted in for a pre-defined period of time (by
default
this is set to two weeks). If you wish to keep this from happening to
a particular room, you can set this option. (Keep in mind that <tt>Lobby&gt;</tt>,
<tt>Aide&gt;</tt>, any private mailbox rooms, any network shared rooms,
and any rooms with a file directory are automatically permanent.)</p>
<pre>Anonymous messages [No]? No<br>Ask users whether to make messages anonymous [No]? No<br></pre>
<p>...you can have rooms in which all messages are automatically
anonymous, and you can have rooms in which users are prompted whether
to make a
message anonymous when they enter it. The real identity of the author
of each message is still revealed to the Room Aide for this room, as
well
as any system-wide Aides.</p>
<pre>Room aide [Joe Responsible]: <br></pre>
<p>...on larger systems, it helps to designate a person to be
responsible for a room. Room Aides have access to a restricted set of
Aide commands, ONLY when they are in the room in which they have this
privilege. They can edit the room, delete the room, delete and move
messages, and invite or kick out users (if it is a private room), but
they cannot perform aide commands that are not room-related (such as
changing users access levels).</p>
<pre>Listing order [64]: <br></pre>
<p>This is just a simple way to try to control the order rooms are
listed in when users call up a <tt><b>K</b>nown Rooms</tt> listing.
Rooms with a lower listing order are displayed prior to rooms with a
higher listing order. It has no other effect. For users who list rooms
in floor order, the display will sort first by floor, then by listing
order.</p>
<pre>Message expire policy (? for list) [0]:<br></pre>
<p>This provides you with the opportunity to select how long each
message will remain in a room before automatically being deleted. Press
<tt><b>?</b></tt> for a list of options. You can choose to keep
messages around forever (or until they are manually deleted), until
they become a certain number of days old, or until a certain number of
additional messages are posted in the room, at which time the oldest
ones will scroll out.</p>
<p>When a new Citadel system is first installed, the default
system-wide
expire policy is set to 'manual' -- no automatic purging of messages
takes place anywhere. For public message boards, you will probably want
to set some sort of automatic expire policy, in order to prevent your
message base from growing forever.</p>
<p>You will notice that you can also fall back to the default expire
policy for the floor upon which the room resides. This is the default
setting. You can change the floor's default with the <tt><b>;A</b>ide <b>E</b>dit
floor</tt> command. The default setting for the floor default, in turn,
is the system default setting, which can be changed using the <tt><b>.A</b>ide
<b>S</b>ystem configuration <b>G</b>eneral</tt> command.</p>
<pre>Save changes (y/n)? Yes<br></pre>
<p>...this gives you an opportunity to back out, if you feel you really
messed things up while editing.<br>
<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="File_directories"></a>File directories</h3>
<p>If you have created any directory rooms, you can attach file
descriptions to the filenames through a special file called <tt>filedir</tt>.
Each line contains the name of a file in the directory, followed by a
space and then a description of the file, such as:</p>
<pre>myfile.txt This is a description of my file.<br>phluff A phile phull of phluff!<br></pre>
<p>...this would create file descriptions for the files <tt>myfile.txt</tt>
and <tt>phluff</tt> which would be displayed along with the directory.
It should also be noted that when users upload files to your system,
they will be prompted for file descriptions, which will be added to the
<tt>filedir</tt> file. If one does not exist, it will be created.<br>
<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="Creating_and_editing_user_accounts"></a>Creating and
editing user accounts</h3>
<p>Anyone with Aide level access may use the <tt><b>.A</b>ide edit <b>U</b>ser</tt>
command to create and/or edit user accounts. There are several
parameters which can be set here.</p>
<p>To create a user:</p>
<pre>Lobby&gt; . Aide edit User <br>User name: New User Name<br>No such user.<br>Do you want to create this user? Yes<br></pre>
<p>At this point, the new user account has been created, and the
command will
continue as if you were editing an existing account. Therefore the
remainder
of this procedure is the same for creating and editing:</p>
<pre>Lobby&gt; . Aide edit User <br>User name: person of significance<br>User #70 - Person of Significance  PW: <br><br>,<br><br>Current access level: 4 (Network User)<br></pre>
<p>The blank lines are the user's 'registration' information --
personal
information such as full name, address, telephone number, etc. This
information
will comprise the user's vCard in both their user profile and in the
Global
Address Book.</p>
<pre>Change password [No]: No<br></pre>
<p>...answer Yes to set or change the password for this account.</p>
<pre>Access level [4]: <br></pre>
<p>...this allows you to set or change the access level for this
account. The access levels available are as follows: </p>
<ul>
  <li>0 - Deleted. (This immediately deletes the account.) </li>
  <li>1 - New, unvalidated user </li>
  <li>2 - Problem user (severely restricts account - use for
probationary access) </li>
  <li>3 - User with no network privileges. Same access as a normal user
except cannot post messages in rooms shared on a network. </li>
  <li>4 - Normal user </li>
  <li>5 - Preferred user (access is granted to privileged rooms) </li>
  <li>6 - Aide (administrative access to the whole system) </li>
</ul>
<pre>Permission to send/receive Internet mail [ No]? No<br></pre>
<p>If your system is configured to only allow Internet mail privileges
to certain users, this is where you can grant or revoke that privilege.</p>
<pre>Ask user to register again [Yes]: Yes<br></pre>
<p>If you answer Yes to this question, the user will be presented with
a
'registration' screen or set of prompts, the next time they log in
using
a Citadel client. This will prompt them for their full name, address,
telephone
number, etc.</p>
<pre>Times called [0]: <br>Messages posted [0]: <br></pre>
<p>These statistics are available for informational purposes only, so
there is normally no need to change them.</p>
<pre>Set last call to now [No]: No<br>Purge time (in days, 0 for system default [0]: <br></pre>
<p>Citadel contains an auto-purger which is capable of automatically
deleting accounts which have not been accessed in a predefined period
of time. If you choose to perform this operation, you can 'touch' the
account
of a wayward user by setting their 'last call' time to 'now'. You can
also adjust, on a per-user basis, the amount of time which must pass
before
their account is purged by the system. This time is set in days. You
can also specify 0 days to indicate that you wish to use the system
default
setting.<br>
<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="Deleting_and_moving_messages"></a>Deleting and moving
messages</h3>
<p>Aides and Room Aides have the ability to delete and move messages.
After each message, the normal prompt appears:</p>
<pre>(8) &lt;B&gt;ack &lt;A&gt;gain &lt;Q&gt;uote &lt;R&gt;eply &lt;N&gt;ext &lt;S&gt;top m&lt;Y&gt; next &lt;?&gt;help -&gt;<br></pre>
<p>Entering <tt><b>D</b>elete</tt> will delete the message. A <tt>(y/n)</tt>
prompt will appear to confirm that you really want to delete the
message. Entering <tt><b>M</b>ove</tt> will prompt for a room to which
the message should be moved.<br>
<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="Customizing_the_help_files"></a>Customizing the help files</h3>
<p>The subdirectory called <tt>help</tt> contains your system's help
files. There's nothing hard-coded into the system that dictates what
files
should be there. Whenever a user types the command <tt><b>.H</b>elp</tt>
followed by the name of a help file, it displays the contents of that
help file.</p>
<p>The help files that come with the system, of course, are enough to
guide a user through its operation. But you can add, change, or remove
help files to suit whatever is appropriate for your system.</p>
<p>There are several strings that you can put in help files that will
be automatically
substituted with other strings. They are:</p>
<pre> <br> ^nodename    = The node name of your system on a Citadel network<br> ^humannode   = Human-readable node name (also your node name on C86Net)<br> ^fqdn        = Your system's fully-qualified domain name<br> ^username    = The name of the user reading the help file<br> ^usernum     = The user number of the user reading the help file<br> ^sysadm      = The name of the system administraor (i.e., you)<br> ^variantname = The name of the software you're running<br> ^bbsdir      = The directory on the host system in which you have<br>                installed the Citadel system.<br></pre>
<p>So, for example, you could create a help file which looked like:</p>
<pre>  "Lots of help, of course, is available right here on ^humannode.  Of<br>course, if you still have trouble, you could always bug ^sysadm about it!"<br><br></pre>
<h3><a name="Site_configuration"></a>Site configuration</h3>
<p>Once your Citadel server is up and running, the first thing you'll
want to do is customize and tune it. This can be done from the
text-based client with the <tt><b>.A</b>ide <b>S</b>ystem
configuration <b>G</b>eneral</tt> command, or from WebCit (if you have
it installed) by clicking 'Advanced Options' followed by 'Edit
site-wide configuration.' Either method will offer the same
configuration options. This document shows the text mode client being
used.</p>
<p>The first set of options deal with the identification of your system.</p>
<pre>Lobby&gt; . Aide System configuration General<br>Node name [uncnsrd]: <br>Fully qualified domain name [uncensored.citadel.org]: <br>Human readable node name [Uncensored]: <br>Modem dialup number [US 914 999 9999]: <br>Geographic location of this system [Mount Kisco, NY]: <br>Name of system administrator [IGnatius T Foobar]: <br>Paginator prompt [<jinkies
 !="" more="" text="" on="" the="" next="" screen="">]: <br></jinkies></pre>
<p>'Node name' refers to the short, unqualified node name by which your
system is known on a Citadel network. Generally it will be the same as
the unqualified host name of your computer; this is, in fact, the
default setting.</p>
<p>Then enter the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) of your system. If
you
are not on the Internet, you can simply set it to the same as your
unqualified host name. Otherwise you should set this value to the host
name by which your system is most commonly known.</p>
<p>The field called 'Human-readable node name' (also known as the 'node
title' or 'organization name' in other software) is used solely for
display purposes. Set it to the actual name of your system as you want
it to appear in
banners, messages, etc.</p>
<p>If you have a modem or bank of modems answering data calls for your
system, enter it in the field marked 'Modem dialup number.' Otherwise
you may leave it blank.</p>
<p>'Geographic location of this system' is another display field. Enter
a city and state, or city and country. </p>
<p>'Name of system administrator' is important! Any user who logs on
with the name you enter here will automatically be granted Aide
privileges. This is one of two ways for the system administrator to
grant himself/herself Aide access to the system when initially setting
it up. (The other is simply to have the first account created on a new
installation.)</p>
<p>The next set of options are your system's security settings. Before
delving into the actual options, we should review the various access
levels available on the system. Citadel has seven access levels:</p>
<ul>
  <li>0 (Deleted). A user whose access level is set to 0 will
automatically be deleted by the system. </li>
  <li>1 (New User). Users at this level may only read messages.
Entering messages is prohibited, except in the <tt>Mail&gt;</tt> room,
where a message to 'sysop' may be entered. </li>
  <li>2 (Problem User). Also known as 'Twit.' </li>
  <li>3 (Local User). May enter messages, except in rooms shared on a
Citadel network. </li>
  <li>4 (Network User). May enter messages in every accessible
room. </li>
  <li>5 (Preferred User). Use of this level is up to the whim of the
system administrator. </li>
  <li>6 (Aide). Access is granted to the administrative functions of
the system. (This access level may also be granted to a user only for a
specific room, please see 'Room Aide' for more information.) </li>
</ul>
<pre>Require registration for new users [No]: No<br>Disable self-service user account creation [No]: No<br>Initial access level for new users [4]:<br>Access level required to create rooms [4]: <br>Automatically give room aide privs to a user who creates a private room [No]: No<br><br>Automatically move problem user messages to twit room [Yes]: Yes<br>Name of twit room [Trashcan]: <br>Restrict Internet mail to only those with that privilege [No]: No<br>Allow Aides to Zap (forget) rooms [Yes]: Yes<br>Log all pages [No]: No<br></pre>
<p>'Registration' refers to the process of a user entering various
personal contact information (real name, address, telephone number,
etc.) into the system. When enabled, this information is stored as a
vCard object on the system in two places: the user's <tt>My Citadel
Config&gt;</tt>
room, and in the <tt>Global Address Book&gt;</tt> room. (Note: the
latter
should be made private on publicly-accessible systems, for obvious
reasons.)</p>
<p>If you answer Yes to 'Require registration for new users' then each
new user, upon creating a new account, will immediately be entered into
the registration process. On the other hand, if you answer Yes to
'Disable self-service user account creation' then new users will not be
able to
log in at all -- all accounts must be created by an Aide.</p>
<p>'Initial access level for new users' should be set to 1 (New User)
if you would like to review each new user's registration info before
granting them higher access. This would be done periodically with the <tt><b>.A</b>ide
<b>V</b>alidate new users</tt> command. If you do not require
registration, you should set the initial access level to 4 (Network
User).</p>
<p>Given the above options, it then becomes clear that there are
generally two ways you can set up your Citadel system, depending on its
purpose:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>A public access BBS or message board</b> - since you do
not know who might want to log in, self-service account creation needs
to
stay enabled. If you want to be strict about users identifying
themselves,
then you should also require users to register (just remember to post a
privacy policy if you're going to collect personal information) -- then
set
the initial access level to 1 (New User), so new users cannot post
messages
until after you've validated them. For a more lax environment, you can
remove the registration requirement and grant new accounts level 4
(Normal
User) access on the first visit. </li>
  <li><b>A private email/groupware system for your organization</b> -
in this case, disable self-service account creation; you don't want
strangers welcoming themselves to your system. You'll probably also
want
to disable registration, because you or some other site administrator
will be entering users' contact info when you create their accounts.
Since this is also how you assign their Internet e-mail addresses, it's
probably a good idea to do it yourself instead of expecting them to do
it. </li>
</ul>
<p>'Access level required to create rooms' is up to you. You might wish
to
restrict the creation of new rooms only to Aides, or you might wish to
allow
anyone to create a room. The latter is one of the Citadel culture's
most
long-standing traditions; the former may be appropriate if users are
abusing
this privilege.</p>
<p>You have the ability to 'Automatically give room aide privs to a
user who creates a private room.' If you answer Yes, then any user who
creates a
guess-name, passworded, or invitation-only room will automatically
become the room aide, and will have access to a subset of the <tt><b>.A</b>ide</tt>
command set while in that room. If you would rather grant this
permission manually, answer No.</p>
<p>Another tradition in the Citadel culture is to refrain from deleting
problem users, but instead to 'twit' them (reduce their access level to
2
[Problem User]). You can then 'Automatically move problem user messages
to twit room' (answer Yes, then specify 'Name of twit room' and
remember
to create that room). If you employ this logic, any user with level 2
(Problem
User) access will continue to have access to the same set of rooms, but
all
messages posted will automatically be routed to the Trashcan (or
whatever
you call your twit room).</p>
<p>If you have Internet mail configured, you have the option of
restricting its use on a user-by-user basis. If you wish to do this,
answer Yes to 'Restrict Internet mail to only those with that
privilege.' Obviously this makes no sense for an internal e-mail
system, but for a public BBS it
might be appropriate.</p>
<p>Normally, Aides have access to every room, public or private.
They are also forbidden from <tt><b>Z</b>ap</tt>ping
rooms, because the review of content is considered one of their roles.
If you wish to change these policies, the next two options allow you
to. You may 'Allow Aides to Zap (forget) rooms', in which case they may
use the <tt><b>Z</b>ap</tt> command just like any other user.
Aides may also <tt><b>.G</b>oto</tt> any private mailbox belonging to
any
user, using a special room name format.</p>
<p>If your local security and/or privacy policy dictates that you keep
a
log of all pages (instant messages) that go through the system, then
answer
Yes to 'Log all pages'. If you answer Yes, you will be prompted for the
name of a room to which all pages will be logged. If you answer No,
then
only the sender and recipient of each individual message will receive a
copy.</p>
<p>The next set of options deals with the tuning of your system. It is
usually safe to leave these untouched.</p>
<pre>Server connection idle timeout (in seconds) [900]: <br>Maximum concurrent sessions [20]: <br>Maximum message length [10000000]: <br>Minimum number of worker threads [5]: <br>Maximum number of worker threads [256]: <br>Automatically delete committed database logs [Yes]:<br></pre>
<p>The 'Server connection idle timeout' is for the connection between
client and server software. It is <b>not</b> an idle timer for the
user interface. 900 seconds (15 minutes) is the default and a sane
setting.</p>
<p>'Maximum concurrent sessions' is the highest number of user sessions
you wish to allow on your system at any given time. Citadel can scale
to hundreds of concurrent users, but if you have limited hardware or
(more likely) limited bandwidth, you might wish to set a maximum. You
can also set it to zero for no limit.</p>
<p>'Maximum message length' is just that. This could be a good way to
prevent enormous multimedia files from finding their way into your
message base. This maximum is enforced in all protocols and is also
advertised by the ESMTP service.</p>
<p>The minimum and maximum number of worker threads can be tuned to
your
liking. Citadel will attempt to keep one worker thread running per
session,
within these constraints. You should be aware that due to the use of
the
worker thread model, Citadel can handle a large number of concurrent
sessions
with a much smaller thread pool. If you don't know the programming
theory
behind multithreaded servers, you should leave these parameters alone.<br>
</p>
<p>'Automatically delete committed database logs' is a <span
 style="font-style: italic;">crucial</span> setting which affects your
system's disk utilization and backup recoverability.&nbsp; Please refer
to the <a href="#Database_maintenance">database maintenance</a>
section of this document to learn how the presence or absence of
database logs affect your ability to reliably backup your Citadel
system.<br>
</p>
<p>The next set of options affect how Citadel behaves on a network.</p>
<pre>Server IP address (0.0.0.0 for 'any') [0.0.0.0]:<br>POP3 server port (-1 to disable) [110]:<br>POP3S server port (-1 to disable) [995]:<br>IMAP server port (-1 to disable) [143]:<br>IMAPS server port (-1 to disable) [993]:<br>SMTP MTA server port (-1 to disable) [25]:<br>SMTP MSA server port (-1 to disable) [587]:<br>SMTPS server port (-1 to disable) [465]:<br>Correct forged From: lines during authenticated SMTP [Yes]:<br>Allow unauthenticated SMTP clients to spoof my domains [No]: No<br>Instantly expunge deleted IMAP messages [No]: Yes<br></pre>
<p>"Server IP address" refers to the IP address on <span
 style="font-style: italic;">your server</span> to which Citadel's
protocol services should be bound.&nbsp; Normally you will leave this
set to 0.0.0.0, which will cause Citadel to listen on all of your
server's interfaces.&nbsp; However, if you are running multiple
Citadels on a server with multiple IP addresses, this is where you
would specify which one to bind this instance of Citadel to.</p>
<p>Then you can specify TCP port numbers for the SMTP, POP3, and IMAP
services. For a system being used primarily for Internet e-mail, these
are essential, so you'll want to specify the standard port numbers: 25,
110, and 143. If Citadel is running alongside some other mail system,
though, then you might want to choose other, unused port numbers, or
enter -1 for any protocol
to disable it entirely.</p>
<p>You'll also notice that you can specify two port numbers for SMTP:
one
for MTA (Mail Transport Agent) and one for MSA (Mail Submission Agent).
The
traditional ports to use for these purposes are 25 and 587. If you are
running an external MTA, such as Postfix (which submits mail to Citadel
using
LMTP) or Sendmail (which submits mail to Citadel using the 'citmail'
delivery agent), that external MTA will be running on port 25, and you
should
specify "-1" for the Citadel MTA port to disable it. The MSA port
(again,
usually 587) would be the port used by end-user mail client programs
such as
Aethera, Thunderbird, Eudora, or Outlook, to submit mail into the
system.
All connections to the MSA port <b>must</b> use Authenticated SMTP.<br>
</p>
<p>The protocols ending in "S" (POP3S, IMAPS, and SMTPS) are
SSL-encrypted.&nbsp; Although all of these protocols support the
STARTTLS command, older client software sometimes requires connecting
to "always encrypted" server ports.&nbsp; Usually when you are looking
at a client program that gives you a choice of "SSL or TLS," the SSL
option will connect to one of these dedicated ports, while the TLS
option will connect to the unencrypted port and then issue a STARTTLS
command to begin encryption.&nbsp; (It is worth noting that this is <span
 style="font-style: italic;">not</span> the proper use of the acronyms
SSL and TLS, but that's how they're usually used in many client
programs.)<br>
</p>
<p>All of the default port numbers, including the encrypted ones, are
the standard ones.<br>
</p>
<p>The question about correcting forged From: lines affects how Citadel
behaves with authenticated SMTP clients. Citadel does not ever allow
third-party SMTP relaying from unauthenticated clients -- any incoming
messages must be
addressed to a user on the system or somewhere in a Citadel network. To
use Citadel with SMTP client software such as Netscape, Outlook,
Eudora, or
whatever, users must log in with a username and password. In order to
prevent
message forgeries, Citadel discards the <tt>From:</tt> line in any
message
entered by an authenticated user, and replaces it with a <tt>From:</tt>
line
containing the user's genuine name and e-mail address. Technically,
this
violates RFC822, because headers are never supposed to be altered, but
common
sense dictates that this is a good idea. Nevertheless, if you want to
suppress
this behavior, answer 'No' at the prompt (the default is 'Yes') and the
headers
will never be altered.</p>
<p>&quot;Instant expunge&quot; affects what happens when IMAP users delete
messages.  As you may already know, messages are not <i>truly</i> deleted
when an IMAP client sends a delete command; they are only <i>marked for
deletion</i>.  The IMAP client must also send an &quot;expunge&quot; command
to actually delete the message.  The Citadel server automatically expunges
messages when the client logs out or selects a different folder, but if you
select the Instant Expunge option, an expunge operation will automatically
follow any delete operation (and the client will be notified, preventing any
mailbox state problems).  This is a good option to select, for example, if you
have users who leave their IMAP client software open all the time and are
wondering why their deleted messages show up again when they log in from a
different location (such as WebCit).</p>
<p>&quot;Allow spoofing&quot; refers to the security level applied to
non-authenticated SMTP clients.  Normally, when another host connects to
Citadel via SMTP to deliver mail, Citadel will reject any attempt to send
mail whose sender (From) address matches one of your host's own domains.  This
forces your legitimate users to authenticate properly, and prevents foreign
hosts (such as spammers) from forging mail from your domains.  If, however,
this behavior is creating a problem for you, you can select this option to
bypass this particular security check.<br>
<span style="font-family: monospace;"><br>
Connect this Citadel to an LDAP directory [No]: No</span><br>
</p>
<p>The LDAP configuration options are discussed elsewhere in this
document.<br>
</p>
<p>The final set of options configures system-wide defaults for the
auto-purger:</p>
<pre>Default user purge time (days) [120]: <br>Default room purge time (days) [30]: <br>System default message expire policy (? for list) [0]: <br>Keep how many messages online? [150]:<br>Mailbox default message expire policy (? for list) [0]:<br>How often to run network jobs (in seconds) [1800]:<br>Enable full text search index (warning: resource intensive) [Yes]: Yes<br>Hour to run purges (0-23) [4]:<br>
Perform journaling of email messages [No]:<br>Perform journaling of non-email messages [No]:<br>Email destination of journalized messages [example@example.com]:<br></pre>
<p>Any user who does not log in for the period specified in 'Default
user purge time' will be deleted the next time a purge is run. This
setting may be modified on a per-user basis.</p>
<p>'Default room purge time' behaves the same way, and may also be
modified on a per-room basis.</p>
<p>'System default message expire policy' defines the way in which old
messages are expired (purged) off the system. You can specify any of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Purge by age (specify in days) </li>
  <li>Purge by message count in the room (specify number of messages) </li>
  <li>Do not purge at all </li>
</ul>
<p>Again, this setting may be overridden on a per-floor basis, and the
floor setting may be overridden on a per-room basis. You'll also notice
that you can set a <i>different</i> default for mailbox rooms if you
want
to. This can allow you, for example, to set a policy under which old
messages scroll out of public rooms, but private mail stays online
indefinitely
until deleted by the mailbox owners.<br>
</p>
<p>"How often to run network jobs" refers to the sharing of content on
a
Citadel network. If your system is on a Citadel network, this
configuration
item dictates how often the Citadel server will contact other Citadel
servers to send and receive messages. In reality, this will happen more
frequently than you specify, because other Citadel servers will be
contacting yours at regular intervals as well.<br>
</p>
<p>"Hour to run purges" determines when expired and/or deleted objects
are purged from the database.&nbsp; These purge operations are
typically run overnight and automatically, sometime during whatever
hour you specify.&nbsp; If your site is much busier at night than
during the day, you may choose to have the auto-purger run during the
day.</p>
<p>"Enable full text search index," if enabled, instructs the server to
build and maintain a searchable index of all messages on the
system.&nbsp; This is a time and resource intensive process -- it could
take days to build the index if you enable it on a large
database.&nbsp; It is also fairly memory intensive; we do not recommend
that you enable the index unless your host system has at least 512 MB
of memory.&nbsp; Once enabled, however, it will be updated
incrementally
and will not have any noticeable impact on the interactive response
time of your system.&nbsp; The full text index is currently only
searchable when using IMAP clients; other search facilities will be
made available in the near future.</p>
<p>The &quot;Perform journaling...&quot; options allow you to configure
your Citadel server to send an extra copy of every message, along with
recipient information if applicable, to the email address of your choice.
The journaling destination address may be an account on the local Citadel
server, an account on another Citadel server on your network, or an Internet
email address.  These options, used in conjunction with an archiving service,
allow you to build an archive of all messages which flow through your Citadel
system.  This is typically used for regulatory compliance in industries which
require such things.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: monospace;">Save this configuration? No</span><br>

Citadel for Internet e-mail</h2>
<div align="justify">
<h3><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h3>
As you know by now, Citadel is a completely self-contained,
full-featured Internet e-mail system. &nbsp;When you run Citadel you do
not need any other mail software on your host system. &nbsp;This
eliminates the need for tedious mucking about with sendmail, qmail,
postfix, Cyrus, the UW IMAP
server, or any of countless other needlessly complex programs that lead
some people to the false assumption that Unix systems are difficult to
administer.<br>
<br>
Some of the many features supported by Citadel are:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Built-in SMTP and ESMTP service, for delivering and receiving
e-mail on the Internet</li>
  <li>Built-in POP3 service, for remote fetching of messages</li>
  <li>Built-in IMAP service, for access to mail using any standard mail
client program</li>
  <li>Web mail (implemented using the "WebCit" middleware, which is
installed separately)</li>
  <li>Support for mailing lists, in both "individual message" and
"digest" formats</li>
  <li>Multiple/virtual domain support</li>
  <li>Any user may have multiple Internet e-mail addresses, in multiple
domains</li>
  <li>Global address book (Users with addresses in a domain may be
spread out across many servers on a Citadel network)</li>
  <li>Easy-to-configure integration with <a
 href="http://www.spamassassin.org/">SpamAssassin</a> can block spam <i>before</i>
it enters the mail system</li>
  <li>Easy-to-configure integration with most Realtime Blackhole
Lists (RBL) provide further defense against spammers</li>
</ul>
This section of the documentation will demonstrate how to configure
these features.<br>
<br>
<h3><a name="Basic_site_configuration"></a>Basic site configuration</h3>
<p>Basic configuration of your Citadel system for Internet e-mail
begins with
the <tt><b>.A</b>ide <b>S</b>ystem configuration <b>I</b>nternet</tt>
command:</p>
<pre>Lobby&gt; <b>.A</b>ide <b>S</b>ystem configuration <b>I</b>nternet<br><br>###                    Host or domain                     Record type<br>--- -------------------------------------------------- --------------------<br>  1<br>&lt;A&gt;dd &lt;D&gt;elete &lt;S&gt;ave &lt;Q&gt;uit  -&gt;<br></pre>
<p>This is a "clean" setup. For a simple, standalone e-mail system you
simply have to enter the <tt><b>A</b>dd</tt> command:</p>
<pre>&lt;A&gt;dd &lt;D&gt;elete &lt;S&gt;ave &lt;Q&gt;uit  -&gt; <b>A</b>dd<br><br>Enter host name: schmeep.splorph.com<br> (1) localhost       (Alias for this computer)<br> (2) gateway domain  (Domain for all Citadel systems)<br> (3) smart-host      (Forward all outbound mail to this host)<br> (4) directory       (Consult the Global Address Book)<br> (5) SpamAssassin    (Address of SpamAssassin server)<br> (6) RBL             (domain suffix of spam hunting RBL)<br><br>Which one [1]:<br></pre>
<p><b>localhost:</b> Basically what you're doing here is telling
Citadel
what any aliases for your machine are. If your machine were <tt>schmeep.splorph.com</tt>
and you also had a DNS entry set up for <tt>blah.com</tt>, you might
want to enter '1' and enter <tt>blah.com</tt> as your alias, so that
e-mail
sent to that address won't bounce.</p>
<p><i>Important tip:</i> if your system is known by one name and <i>only</i>
one domain, you might not even need to do this at all. You will recall
that you entered your system's fully qualified domain name earlier when
you went through the <tt><b>.A</b>ide <b>S</b>ystem configuration <b>G</b>eneral</tt>
command. The domain name you entered there is automatically considered
by Citadel to be a 'localhost' entry in your Internet mail
configuration. It does not hurt to enter it in both locations, though.</p>
<p><b>gateway domain:</b> this is a simple way of mapping various
Citadel hosts in an Internet domain. For example, if you enter <tt>bar.com</tt>
as a gateway domain, then mail to users at <tt>foo.bar.com</tt> will
be forwarded to the host called <tt>foo</tt> on a Citadel network,
mail to users
at <tt>kunst.bar.com</tt> will be delivered to the Citadel server
called
<tt>kunst</tt>, etc. This feature has limited usefulness; if you are
operating
a network of Citadel servers, it is more likely that you will use the
'directory'
feature, explained below.</p>
<p><b>smart-host:</b> Normally, Citadel sends outbound Internet e-mail
directly to its destination. This may not be appropriate for some
sites; you may require (due to local convention, security policy, or
whatever) that all outbound mail be sent to an SMTP relay or forwarder.
To configure this
functionality, simply enter the domain name or IP address of your relay
as a 'smart-host' entry.  If your relay server is running on a port other
than the standard SMTP port 25, you can also specify the port number
using &quot;host:port&quot; syntax; i.e. <tt>relay99.myisp.com:2525</tt></p>
<p><b>directory:</b> a domain for which you are participating in
directory services across any number of Citadel nodes. For example, if
users who have addresses in the domain <tt>citadel.org</tt> are spread
out across multiple Citadel servers on your network, then enter <tt>citadel.org</tt>
as a 'directory' entry. <i>For this to work, all Citadel servers
participating in directory service <b>must</b> carry and share the <tt>Global
Address Book&gt;</tt> room.</i></p>
<p><b>spamassassin:</b> if you are running a <a
 href="http://www.spamassassin.org">SpamAssassin</a> service anywhere
on your
<b>local</b> network, enter its name or IP address as a 'spamassassin'
entry. This may be (and, in fact, will usually be) <tt>127.0.0.1</tt>
to specify
that the service is running on the same host computer as the Citadel
server.</p>
<p>Please install SpamAssassin as per its own documentation. You will
want to run SpamAssassin in client/server mode, where a <tt>spamd</tt>
daemon is always running on your computer. Citadel does not utilize the
<tt>spamc</tt> client; instead, it implements SpamAssassin's protocol
on its own.</p>
<p>Connecting to a SpamAssassin service across a wide area network is
strongly discouraged. In order to determine whether an incoming e-mail
is spam, Citadel must feed the <i>entire message</i> to the
SpamAssassin service. Doing this over a wide area network would consume
time and bandwidth,
which would affect performance.</p>
<p>Citadel invokes the SpamAssassin service when incoming messages are
arriving via SMTP. Before a message is accepted, it is submitted to
SpamAssassin. If SpamAssassin determines that the message is spam, the
Citadel SMTP
service <i>rejects the message,</i> causing a delivery failure on the
sending
host. This is superior to software which files away spam in a separate
folder, because delivery failures will cause some spammers to assume
the
address is invalid and remove it from their mailing lists.</p>
<p><b>RBL:</b> Realtime Blackhole Lists (RBL's) provide defense against
spammers based on their source IP address. There are many such lists
available on the Internet, some of which may be utilized free of
charge. Since they are DNS based, the lists do not require storage on
your server -- they are queried during the SMTP conversation.</p>
<p>Citadel can utilize any RBL that uses the <tt>z.y.x.w.nameoflist.org</tt>
syntax, where <tt>w.x.y.z</tt> is the source IP address which is
attempting to deliver mail to your server. For example, <a
 href="http://www.spamcop.net">SpamCop</a> would use the query <tt>2.0.0.127.bl.spamcop.net</tt>
to determine whether the host at <tt>127.0.0.2</tt> is a known spammer
or open relay. In this case, you simply select option '6' to add an RBL
entry, and provide it with the domain suffix of <tt>bl.spamcop.net</tt>
(the IP address
and extra dot will be automatically prepended for each query).</p>
<p>Now select <tt><b>S</b>ave</tt> and you are just about ready for
Internet e-mail.</p>
<h3><a name="Enabling_the_Internet_mail_protocols"></a>Enabling the
Internet mail protocols</h3>
<p>As previously mentioned, Citadel contains its own SMTP, POP3, and
IMAP services. Enabling them is simple.</p>
<p>Check for the existance of a current MTA (sendmail, qmail, etc.) by
connecting to port 25 on your host. If you see something similar to the
following
you're running an MTA already and you'll need to shut it down:</p>
<pre>smw @ pixel % telnet localhost 25<br>Trying 127.0.0.1...<br>Connected to localhost.<br>Escape character is '^]'.<br>220 pixel.citadel.org ESMTP Sendmail 8.9.3/8.9.3; Wed, 15 Mar 2000 19:00:53 -0500<br></pre>
<p>In the above example, we see that the host already has Sendmail
listening on port 25. Before Citadel can use port 25, Sendmail must be
shut off. Please consult the documentation for your operating system
for instructions on how to do this. (On a Red Hat Linux system, for
example, you can run the <tt>ntsysv</tt> utility, un-checking <tt>sendmail</tt>
to disable it at
the next reboot; then, run <tt>service sendmail stop</tt> to shut off
the
currently running service.)</p>
<p>If you get a 'connection refused' message when you telnet to port 25
there's nothing running and you should be able to continue. You might
also want to turn off POP (try the above test substituting 110 for 25)
and IMAP (port 143) and use Citadel's POP and IMAP services.</p>
<p>Citadel will look for an existing pop/smtp server on startup. If
they
don't exist (and you've configured them properly) then Citadel should
enable
them at startup. You can check your logs to be sure, or you can start
the
server from a shell and watch it load. It might look something like
this:</p>
<font size="-2"> </font>

<p>The lines emphasized in boldface in the above log output tell you
that Citadel "can't bind" to various ports. The error 'address already
in use' generally means that something else is already running on the
requested port. Make SURE you've followed the above steps to remove
sendmail/pop and start your Citadel server again.</p>
<h3><a name="citmail"></a>Using Citadel in conjunction with another MTA</h3>
<p>Occationally it is not practical to remove a non-Citadel MTA on your
host system. For example, you might have multiple groups of users, some
of
which are using Citadel and some of which are using a legacy Unix mail
spool. This type of configuration is discouraged, but two tools are
provided
to allow it.</p>
<p>The tool is called <tt>citmail</tt> and it is, quite simply, a
local MDA (Mail Delivery Agent) which you can configure into your MTA
for final delivery of incoming messages to Citadel users. A full
discussion of the finer points of complex Sendmail configurations is
beyond the scope of this document; however, you might want to visit <a
 href="http://pixel.citadel.org/citadel/docs/">Pixel BBS</a> where some
useful HOWTO documents are provided.<br>
</p>
<p>The other tool is an <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2033.html">RFC2033</a>
compliant LMTP service running on a local socket.&nbsp; If you're
running a mailer that speaks LMTP (such as <a
 href="http://www.postfix.org/">Postfix</a>), you can simply point your
mailer at the socket called <span style="font-family: monospace;">citadel.socket</span>
in your Citadel directory.&nbsp; For example, in Postfix you might put
the following line into <span style="font-family: monospace;">main.cf</span>
in order to tell it to use Citadel to deliver mail to local recipients:<br>
</p>
<pre>local_transport = lmtp:unix:/usr/local/citadel/lmtp.socket<br></pre>
<p>Postfix also has something called a "fallback transport" which can
be used to implement Citadel as a "secondary" mail system on your
server, while keeping the existing Unix mailboxes intact.&nbsp;
However, it is beyond the scope of this document to detail the finer
points of the configuration of Postfix or any other mailer, so refer to
the documentation to those programs and keep in mind that Citadel has
LMTP support.<span style="font-family: monospace;"></span></p>
<p>There are actually <i>two</i> LMTP sockets. One is called
<tt>lmtp.socket</tt> and the other is called <tt>lmtp-unfiltered.socket</tt>
(both are found in your Citadel directory). The difference should be
obvious: messages submitted via <tt>lmtp.socket</tt> are subject to
any
spam filtering you may have configured (such as SpamAssassin), while
messages
submitted via <tt>lmtp-unfiltered.socket</tt> will bypass the filters.
You
would use the filtered socket when receiving mail from an external MTA
such
as Postfix, but you might want to use the unfiltered socket with
utilities
such as fetchmail.</p>
<br>
<p>For outbound mail, you
can either allow Citadel to perform
deliveries directly
(this won't affect your other mail system because outbound mail doesn't
tie
up port 25) or enter <tt>127.0.0.1</tt> as your smart-host, which will
tell
Citadel to forward all of its outbound mail to your other mail system.</p>
<h3><a name="Hosting_an_Internet_mailing_list"></a>Hosting an Internet
mailing list</h3>
<p>Citadel has built in mailing list service (known in the 'net
vernacular as "listserv") functionality. &nbsp;You can turn any room
into a mailing list. &nbsp;Users can then choose how they participate
-- by logging on to your Citadel server directly, or by having the
room's contents mailed to
them somewhere else. &nbsp;Configuring this is easy.</p>
<p>Citadel supports two modes of mailing list delivery: </p>
<ul>
  <li>"List mode" -- each individual message is delivered as a single
e-mail to each list mode recipient. &nbsp;The "From:" header will
display the address of the message's original author.</li>
  <li>"Digest mode" -- groups of one or more messages are delivered
to digest mode recipients. &nbsp;The number of messages in the group
depends on how many new messages arrived since the last batch was
delivered. &nbsp;The "From:" header will display the address of the
room itself, which allows replies to be posted back to the room.</li>
</ul>
A room may have any combination of list mode and digest mode
recipients.
<p>As alluded to above, every room on your Citadel system has an
Internet e-mail address of its own. &nbsp;Messages sent to that address
will be
posted in the room (and sent back out to mailing list recipients, as
well
as to any other Citadels you share the room with). &nbsp;The address
format
is <tt>room_</tt> plus the name of the room, with any spaces replaced
by
underscores, followed by <tt>@</tt> and your hostname. For example, if
your
system is known as <tt>phlargmalb.orc.org</tt> on the Internet, and
you have
a room called <tt>Bubblegum Collectors</tt>, you can post to that room
from
anywhere on the Internet simply by sending an e-mail to <tt>room_bubblegum_collectors@phlargmalb.orc.org</tt>.
When the message arrives, it's automatically posted in that room.</p>
<p>To manually edit the list of "list mode" recipients, simply enter
the <tt><b>.A</b>ide
mailing <b>L</b>ist management</tt> command. Your text editor will
open
up and you will be able to create or edit a list of recipients, one per
line. Lines beginning with a hash (<tt>#</tt>) are comments.</p>
<p>To manually edit the list of "digest mode" recipients, enter the <tt><b>.A</b>ide
mailing list <b>D</b>igest recipients</tt> command. As with the
previous command, the text editor will open up and you can edit the
list of digest mode recipients, one per line.</p>
<p>Citadel also has a facility which allows users to subscribe or
unsubscribe to mailing lists using a web browser. In order to do this,
WebCit must also be running on your server in addition to Citadel.
WebCit is obtained and installed separately from the rest of the
Citadel system.</p>
<p>In order to prevent "just anyone" from subscribing to any room on
your system, there is a setting in the <tt><b>.A</b>ide <b>E</b>dit

Self-service list subscribe/unsubscribe [No]: Yes<br></pre>
<p>When you answer "Yes" to self-service list subscribe/unsubscribe,
you are
enabling that feature. Now, all you have to do is tell the world about
the
web page they need to visit. It looks like this:</p>
<center><tt>http://foobar.baz.org:2000/listsub</tt></center>
<p>In this example, the server is called <tt>foobar.baz.org</tt> and
WebCit is running on port 2000. Edit appropriately.</p>
<p>Citadel offers a subscribe/unsubscribe facility that is more
intuitive than other listservs. With most systems, sending commands to
the listserv requires that you e-mail it commands in a special format.
It's easy to get it wrong. Citadel simply uses your web browser. You
select the list you want to subscribe or unsubscribe (hint: it's the
list of rooms you've enabled self-service for), select whether you want
list mode or digest mode, and enter your e-mail address. For security
purposes, a confirmation message is sent to the address you enter. But
you don't have to reply to the message in a weird format, either: the
confirmation contains another URL which
you simply click on (or paste into your browser if you can't click on
URL's
in your e-mail software) and the confirmation is automatically
completed.</p>

<h2><a name="Building_or_joining_a_Citadel_network"></a>Building or
joining a Citadel network</h2>
</center>
<h3><a name="Overview__"></a>Overview</h3>
<p>If you are running Citadel as a BBS or other forum type of
application, one way to 'keep the conversation going' is to share rooms
with other Citadel systems. In a shared room, a message posted to the
room is automatically
propagated to every system on the network. It's kind of like a UseNet
newsgroup,
but without the spam.</p>
<p>If you are using Citadel as the e-mail and groupware platform for a
large organization, you can use its networking features to build a
large network of Citadel servers which share content (think of rooms as
public folders), redistribute e-mail throughout the organization, and
integrate the global address book. &nbsp;It might make sense, for
example, in a large corporation to give each department or location its
own Citadel server. &nbsp;Thanks
to Citadel's global address book features, you could still have all of
the
users share a single e-mail domain.</p>
<p>Obviously, the first thing you have to do is find another Citadel to
share rooms with, and make arrangements with them. The following
Citadels are a good place to start:</p>
<ul>
  <li>UNCENSORED! - <a href="http://uncensored.citadel.org">uncensored.citadel.org</a>
  </li>
  <li>The Dog Pound II - <a href="http://dogpound2.citadel.org">dogpound2.citadel.org</a>
  </li>
  <li>PixelBBS - <a href="http://pixel.citadel.org">pixel.citadel.org</a>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>You don't have to be a part of the citadel.org domain to participate
in the public Citadel network, but the DNS service is provided free of
charge by the Citadel community if you wish to do this.</p>
<h3><a name="Conventions_and_etiquette_when"></a>Conventions and
etiquette when connecting to the public Citadel network</h3>
<p>Before we get into the technical nitty gritty, there are two points
of etiquette to keep in mind. The first thing to keep in mind is that
the operator of any particular Citadel may not be willing to share some
of his/her rooms. Some sites are proud to offer exclusive content in
certain areas. Chances are, if a room is already being shared on the
network, it's available for anyone to share; if not, it can't hurt to
ask -- but take care not to demand it of them. Ask if you may share the
room instead of telling them that you wish to share the room. When
looking at a <tt><b>K</b></tt>nown rooms list, network rooms are the
ones ending in parentheses instead of angle brackets. For example, <tt>Gateway)</tt>
would be a network room, <tt>Lobby&gt;</tt> would not.</p>
<p>The other point of etiquette to remember is that you should be
making
the arrangements in advance, and then set it up. It is extremely rude
to
simply begin networking with another Citadel, or unilaterally start
sharing
a new room, without first obtaining permission from its operator.
Always
ask first. Most Citadel operators are more than happy to network with
you. Also, if later on you decide to take your system down, please take
the time
to notify the operators of any other Citadels you network with, so they
can
unconfigure their end.</p>
<h3><a name="Getting_ready_to_join_the_network"></a>Getting ready to
join the network</h3>
<p>Ok, first things first. On a Citadel room sharing network, the first
thing you need to know is your own system's node name. Presumably you
set
this up during installation, but if you want to change it you can do so
using
the <tt><b>.A</b>ide <b>S</b>ysconfig <b>G</b>eneral</tt> command:</p>
<pre>Lobby&gt; . Aide System configuration General<br>Node name [uncnsrd]:<br>Fully qualified domain name [uncensored.citadel.org]:<br>Human readable node name [Uncensored]:<br></pre>
<p>The "node name" is important, it's how the network identifies
messages coming from your system. The "human readable node name" is
simply a label; it shows up in messages coming from your system. "Fully
qualified domain name" is your DNS name; it's used for routing messages
on the Internet. In the above example, the node name is "uncnsrd".</p>
<h3><a name="Defining_neighbor_nodes"></a>Defining neighbor nodes</h3>
<p>The next thing you need to do is configure your neighbor node(s).
You need to do this for each node you network with. Let's say you
wanted
to talk to a Citadel system called "frobozz". Use the <tt><b>.A</b>ide
<b>S</b>ysconfig <b>N</b>etwork</tt> command:</p>
<pre>Lobby&gt; . Aide System configuration Network<br>###    Node            Secret                   Host or IP             Port#<br>--- ---------------- ---------------- -------------------------------- -----<br>&lt;A&gt;dd &lt;D&gt;elete &lt;S&gt;ave &lt;Q&gt;uit  -&gt; Add<br><br>Enter node name    : frobozz<br>Enter shared secret: frotz<br>Enter host or IP   : frobozz.magick.org<br>Enter port number  :  [504]: 504<br><br>###    Node            Secret                   Host or IP             Port#<br>--- ---------------- ---------------- -------------------------------- -----<br>  1 frobozz          frotz            frobozz.magick.org               504<br>&lt;A&gt;dd &lt;D&gt;elete &lt;S&gt;ave &lt;Q&gt;uit  -&gt; Save<br><br>Lobby&gt;<br></pre>
<p>As you can see in the above example, you have to enter the Citadel
node name, the DNS name or IP address of the server, and the port
number the Citadel service is running on. The "shared secret" is a
password to allow the two Citadel nodes to connect to each other to
exchange network data. The password must be <i>identical</i> on both
ends of the connection -- when the operator of the other Citadel node
sets up the connection with
your system, he/she must use the same password.</p>
<h3><a name="Sharing_rooms"></a>Sharing rooms</h3>
<p>Now you're ready to share rooms. You have to do this for each room
you want to share, and you have to do it from BOTH ENDS -- again, when
you
share a room with another Citadel, they must share it with you as well.
Let's say you have a room called "Quiche Recipes&gt;" and you want to
share
it with the node you set up above. First, edit the room and flag it as
a
network room:</p>
<pre>Quiche Recipes&gt; . Aide Edit this room<br>Room name [Quiche Recipes]:<br>Private room  [No]: No<br>Preferred users only  [No]: No<br>Read-only room  [No]: No<br>Directory room  [No]: No<br>Permanent room  [No]: No<br>Network shared room  [No]: Yes<br>Automatically make all messages anonymous  [No]: No<br>Ask users whether to make messages anonymous  [No]: No<br>Listing order [64]:<br>Room aide (or 'none') [none]:<br>Message expire policy (? for list) [0]:<br>Save changes (y/n)? Yes<br>Ok<br><br>Quiche Recipes)<br></pre>
<p>Notice how the prompt changed? It was &gt; before, but it's ) now.
That means it's a network room. Now you can tell Citadel that you want
to
share the room with frobozz. Enter this command:</p>
<pre>Quiche Recipes) . Aide Network room sharing<br></pre>
<p>Your text editor will pop up (you <i>did</i> configure Citadel to
use
your favorite text editor, right?) with a screen that looks like this:</p>
<pre># Configuration for room: Quiche Recipes<br># Nodes with which we share this room<br># Specify one per line.<br></pre>
<p>All you have to do is enter the name of the other Citadel node (i.e.
"frobozz" in our example) on a line by itself. As usual, lines starting
with a
"#" are comments. Just go to the end of the file, type "frobozz"
(without
the quotes), save the file... and you're done!</p>
<p>At this point, you just sit back and enjoy. Your Citadel and the
other one will begin polling each other at regular intervals (once per
hour
by default) and sharing messages.</p>
<h3><a name="Sending_mail"></a>Sending mail</h3>
<p>You can send mail to any user on any node of your Citadel network.
It may take a little while for your system to learn the entire node
list, though, as this is done by watching incoming messages on the
network and learning which nodes are out there.</p>
<p>To send a private message, just enter <tt>user @ host</tt> as the
recipient:</p>
<pre>Mail&gt; Enter message                                                            <br>Enter recipient: Some other user @ frobozz<br> Feb 11 2003 11:36pm from I. M. Me to Some other user @ frobozz<br>type message here...<br><br>Entry command (? for options)  -&gt;<br><br></pre>
<h3><a name="Changing_the_polling_interval"></a>Changing the polling
interval</h3>
<p>As previously mentioned, Citadel will poll other Citadel nodes for
messages once per hour. If this is not an acceptable interval, you can
change it using the <tt><b>.A</b>ide <b>S</b>ystem configuration <b>G</b>eneral</tt>
command. Enter this command and look for the option:</p>
<pre>How often to run network jobs (in seconds) [3600]:<br></pre>
<p>Change it to whatever you like. For example, 15 minutes is 900
seconds. So if you changed the default value to 900, network polling
would occur every 15 minutes.</p>
<hr>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Database_maintenance"></a>Database
maintenance</h2>
<h3><a name="Introduction_"></a>Introduction</h3>
The data store used by Citadel is reliable and self-maintaining.
&nbsp;It requires very little maintenance. &nbsp;This is primarily due
to its use of the <a href="http://www.sleepycat.com">Berkeley DB</a>
record manager. &nbsp;It is robust, high-performance, and transactional.<br>
<br>
A few small data files are kept in your main Citadel directory, but the
databases are in the <tt>data/</tt> subdirectory. &nbsp;The files with
names that begin with "cdb" are the databases themselves; the files
with names that begin with "log" are the logs (sometimes referred to as
"journals").&nbsp; Log files will continue to appear as you use your
system; each will grow to approximately 10 megabytes in size before a
new one is started.&nbsp; There is a system configuration setting
(found in <span style="font-family: monospace;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">.A</span>ide <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">S</span>ystem-configuration <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">G</span>eneral</span> in the text mode
client, or in <span style="font-family: monospace;">Administration
--&gt; Edit site-wide configuration --&gt; Tuning</span> in the WebCit
client) which specifies "Automatically delete committed database
logs."&nbsp; If you have this option enabled, Citadel will
automatically delete any log files whose contents have been fully
committed to the database files.<br>
<br>
For more insight into how the database and log files work, you may wish
to read the <a
 href="http://www.sleepycat.com/docs/ref/transapp/archival.html">Berkeley
DB documentation</a> on this subject.<br>
<br>
<h3><a name="Backing_up_your_Citadel_database"></a>Backing up your
Citadel database</h3>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Please read this section carefully.</span><br>
<br>
There are two backup strategies you can use, depending on your site's
availability requirements and disk space availability.<br>
<h5>Strategy #1: Standard backup</h5>
The standard (or "offline") backup is used when your Citadel server is
configured to automatically delete committed database logs.&nbsp; The
backup procedure is as follows:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Shut down the Citadel server.</li>
  <li>Back up all files (database files, log files, etc.) to tape or
some other backup media.</li>
  <li>Start the Citadel server.</li>
</ol>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Advantage:</span> very little disk
space is consumed by the logs.<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Disadvantage:</span> Citadel is not
available during backups.<br>
<br>
<h5>Strategy #2: "Hot" backup</h5>
The "hot backup" procedure is used when your Citadel server is
configured <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> to
automatically delete committed database logs.&nbsp; The backup
procedure is as follows:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Back up all files.&nbsp; Make sure the database files (<span
 style="font-family: monospace;">cdb.*</span>) are backed up <span
 style="font-style: italic;">before</span> the log files (<span
 style="font-family: monospace;">log.*</span>).&nbsp; This will usually
be the case, because the database files tend to appear first in both
alphabetical and on-disk ordering of the <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">data/</span> directory.</li>
  <li>After verifying that your backup completed successfully, delete
the committed log files with a command like this:</li>
</ol>
<span style="font-family: monospace;">/usr/local/citadel/sendcommand
"CULL"</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Advantage:</span> Citadel continues
to run normally during backups.<span style="font-style: italic;"><br>
Disadvantage:</span> Much disk space is consumed by the log files,
particularly if the full text indexer is turned on.<br>
<br>
<br>
It is up to you to decide which backup strategy to use.&nbsp; <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Warning: if you configure Citadel to
automatically delete committed database logs, and do not shut the
Citadel service down during backups, there is no guarantee that your
backups will be usable!</span><br>
<br>
<h3><a name="Database_repair"></a>Database repair</h3>
Although Citadel's data store is quite reliable, database corruption
can occur in rare instances. &nbsp;External factors such as an
operating
system crash or an unexpected loss of power might leave the database in
an unknown state. &nbsp;A utility is provided which may be able to
repair
your database if this occurs. &nbsp;If you find that your Citadel
server
is not running, and reading the logs shows that it is crashing because
of
an inability to validate a database, follow these steps:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Edit <tt>/etc/inittab</tt> and switch the Citadel service from
"respawn" to "off." &nbsp;Type <tt>init q</tt> to make this setting
permanent.</li>
  <li><b>Make a backup of your data.</b> &nbsp;Either write it out to
tape or copy it to another directory, or a tarball.<br>
  </li>
  <li><tt>cd</tt> to your Citadel directory and type <tt>./database_cleanup.sh</tt></li>
  <li>Let the cleanup script run. &nbsp;<b>Do not interrupt this
process for any reason.</b><br>
  </li>
  <li>Edit <tt>/etc/inittab</tt> and switch the Citadel service from
"off" to "respawn". &nbsp;Type <tt>init q</tt> to activate your
changes.</li>
</ol>
If this procedure does not work, you must restore from your most recent
backup.<br>
<br>
<h3><a name="ImportingExporting_your_Citadel"></a>Importing/Exporting
your Citadel database<br>
</h3>
<p>Citadel contains an importer/exporter module, affectionately
known as the "Art Vandelay" module (a not-so-obscure Seinfeld
reference). It
allows you to export the entire contents of your Citadel databases to a
flat file, which may then be imported on another system. (This
procedure
is also known as "dump and load" to database gurus.)</p>
<p>Why would you want to do this? &nbsp;Here are some scenarios: </p>
<ul>
  <li>You are moving a Citadel installation to another computer, which
uses a different CPU. Since Citadel stores data in an
architecture-dependent format, the data files wouldn't work on the new
computer as-is. </li>
  <li>Your computer crashed, lost power, etc. and you suspect that your
databases have become corrupted. </li>
  <li>You want to switch to a different back-end data store. (For
example, from GDBM to Berkeley DB) </li>
</ul>
<p>So ... how do we work this magic? Follow these steps <i>exactly</i>
as documented and you should be able to do it all with very little
trouble.</p>
<ol>
  <li>This should be obvious, but it's still worth mentioning: &nbsp;<b>Make
sure you have a backup of everything before you start this!&nbsp;</b>
You're performing a major operation here. Don't risk it. </li>
  <li>First, get all the users logged off from your system. Disconnect
it from the network if possible. You don't want anyone logging in while
you're doing this. </li>
  <li>Log on as root, or some other user that has read/write access to
all relevant files. </li>
  <li>Go to the directory that Citadel is installed in. For example,
issue a command like <tt>cd /usr/local/citadel</tt> </li>
  <li>Export the databases with the following command:<br>
    <br>
    <tt>./sendcommand "ARTV export" &gt;exported.dat</tt><br>
    <br>
This command may run for a while. On a very large system it could take
an hour or more. Please be patient! </li>
  <li>When the export completes, check to make sure that <tt>exported.dat</tt>
exists and has some data in it. (Type "ls -l exported.dat") </li>
  <li>Shut down the Citadel server. If you have a line in <tt>/etc/inittab</tt>
that reads like this:<br>
    <br>
    <tt>c1:2345:respawn:/usr/local/citadel/citserver
-h/usr/local/citadel</tt> <br>
...then you should change the <tt>respawn</tt> to <tt>off</tt> and
then type <tt>/sbin/init q</tt> to make the changes take effect. </li>
  <li>Now it's time to delete your current binary databases. Type:<br>
    <br>
    <tt>rm -f citadel.config citadel.control data/*</tt> </li>
  <li>If you're moving Citadel to another computer, you should move the
    <i>entire</i> directory over at this time. <tt>exported.dat</tt>
only contains the information that was in the binary databases.
Information which was stored in portable formats doesn't need to be
exported/imported, so
you must bring it all over in its current form. </li>
  <li>Now get Citadel running on the new computer (or whatever). Run <tt>setup</tt>
and turn the service back on (from <tt>/etc/inittab</tt>) but DO NOT
log in. </li>
  <li>As root, run the import command:<br>
    <br>
    <tt>./sendcommand "ARTV import" &lt;exported.dat</tt><br>
    <br>
This will import your databases. Again, it may run for a long time. </li>
  <li>Restart the Citadel server. You can do this any way you like.
From the command line, you can do it with a command like:<br>
    <br>
    <tt>./sendcommand "DOWN"</tt> <br>
  </li>
  <li>Now you're finished. Log in and test everything. You may delete
exported.dat at this time, or you might want to save it somewhere as a
sort of pseudo-backup. </li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="crypto"></a>Cryptography support (TLS/SSL)</h2>
</center>
<h3><a name="crypto_intro"></a>Overview</h3>
<p>Citadel provides built-in support for encryption using Transport
Layer Security (TLS) for ESMTP, IMAP, POP3, and the Citadel client
protocol.
A simple cryptographic configuration is installed automatically when
you
bring the system online. The remainder of this section describes how
this
configuration is built, and what you can do to make changes to it.</p>
<p>Encryption files are kept in the <tt>keys/</tt> directory. The
three
files used by Citadel are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><tt>citadel.key</tt> - Contains your system's RSA private key.
Citadel
generates a new key automatically if one is not found. </li>
  <li><tt>citadel.csr</tt> - Contains a Certificate Signing Request
(CSR)
for your system. Citadel generates a new CSR automatically, using your
private key, if one is not found. </li>
  <li><tt>citadel.cer</tt> - Contains the public certificate for your
system. The public key in the certificate <b>must</b> correspond with
the
private key in <tt>citadel.key</tt>, otherwise encryption will not
function properly. Citadel will generate a self-signed certificate,
again
using your private key, if a certificate is not found. </li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="real_cert"></a>Generating and installing a Trusted
Certificate</h3>
<p>If you wish to interact with 3rd party clients
that have hard coded lists of acceptable Certificate Authorities, and
you
do not want annoying dialog boxes popping up for the user on the first
(or
all) connections, then you will have to have your key signed by a valid
Certificate Authority.</p>
<p>It is beyond the scope of this document to provide a complete
tutorial
on SSL certificates. Here are the general rules to follow:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Generally, the Certificate Signing Requeste which is
automatically
generated by Citadel will not contain enough information for any
Certificate
Authority to sign it. Generate a new CSR with the following commands:<br>
    <br>
    <tt>cd keys</tt><br>
    <tt>openssl req -new -key citadel.key -out citadel.csr</tt><br>
    <br>
Answer all questions (your geographic location, organization name,
etc.)
and then send the new <tt>citadel.csr</tt> to your Certificate
Authority
when you order the certificate. </li>
  <li>When the certificate is received, simply save it as <tt>citadel.cer</tt>
and restart the Citadel server. </li>
  <li>If your certificate authority delivers a 'chained' certificate
(one
with intermediate certificate authorities), simply append the
intermediate
certificate after your server's own certificate in the <tt>citadel.cer</tt>
file.</li>

<h2><a name="LDAP_Directory_Support"></a>LDAP (Directory) Support</h2>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<h3><a name="Introduction_ldap"></a>Introduction</h3>
LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) has become the open
standard protocol for directory access.&nbsp; There are many client
programs which are capable of making use of an LDAP directory
service.&nbsp; Therefore it may be beneficial for some sites to have a
directory available which is populated with Citadel user information.<br>
<br>
Citadel does not contain its own LDAP service, because that would
eliminate its ability to coexist with any existing directory you may
already have in place at your organization.&nbsp; Instead, we provide
the LDAP Connector for Citadel, which allows the Citadel service to
populate an external LDAP directory.&nbsp; If you do not already have
an LDAP directory in place, you can use the OpenLDAP server, which is
probably already present in your operating system, or at least can be
loaded from the installation CD's.&nbsp; The supplied configuration
file <tt>citadel-slapd.conf</tt> can be used as a starting
point to get your LDAP server running.<br>
<br>
<h3><a name="Preparing_your_LDAP_server_for_Citadel"></a>Preparing your
LDAP server for Citadel connections</h3>
It is difficult to find a commonly accepted LDAP scheme. It seems, most
real life LDAP installations go for the domain oriented apporach
and lay out the structure after an existing domain/subdomain structure.
<p> The most widely accepted and standardized object for storing
personal data
clearly is "inetOrgPerson".&nbsp; Citadel therefore attempts to follow
this type of schema.<br>
</p>
<p>If you are using OpenLDAP as your directory server, you should
choose options similar to the following:<br>
</p>
<pre>database        ldbm<br>schemacheck     off<br>allow           bind_v2<br>suffix          "dc=servername,dc=domain,dc=org"<br>rootdn          "cn=manager,dc=servername,dc=domain,dc=org"<br>rootpw          secret<br></pre>
<ul>
  <li>Obviously, you can make your suffix and rootdn whatever you wish,
but in most cases you'd simply follow a DC path that looks similar to
your DNS domain.</li>
  <li>If you don't want LDBM, feel free to choose any backend available
on your system.</li>
  <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">bind_v2</span> is <span
 style="font-style: italic;">required</span> because Citadel will make
v2 protocol connections.</li>
  <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">schemacheck off</span> is <span
 style="font-style: italic;">recommended</span> because Citadel uses
fields that do not necessarily exist in your system's default
schema.&nbsp; If you don't like that idea, your other option is to
reference the included <span style="font-family: monospace;">citadel-openldap.schema</span>
in your configuration.</li>
  <li>Your <span style="font-family: monospace;">rootdn</span> and <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">rootpw</span> can be whatever you
want.&nbsp; Usually the rootdn is <span style="font-family: monospace;">cn=manager,</span>
followed by your usual suffix.&nbsp; Please don't use <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">secret</span> as your password, as in
this example.&nbsp; Select a new password for your site.</li>
</ul>
<br>
Your LDAP service <span style="font-weight: bold;">must</span> be up

Once you've done this, restart your Citadel service with the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: monospace;">.A</span></span><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">ide <span style="font-weight: bold;">T</span>erminate-server
<span style="font-weight: bold;">N</span>ow</span> command.&nbsp; When
Citadel restarts, it will connect to your LDAP directory.&nbsp; Note
that we gave Citadel the same Base DN, Bind DN, and password that was
in our LDAP server configuration example.&nbsp; Obviously, everything
needs to be identical on both sides or the connection will be
refused.&nbsp; 127.0.0.1 is the loopback address, and 389 is the
standard port number for LDAP, so this would be the proper host and
port combination for an LDAP service running on your local
server.&nbsp; It could just as easily be on another server, for example
an organization-wide directory server.<br>
<br>
You can also configure the LDAP Connector for Citadel from a WebCit
session.&nbsp; Log on as an Aide and click on Advanced Options --&gt;
Edit Site-Wide Configuration --&gt; Directory, and you will be
presented with the same set of questions.<br>
<br>
So, what kind of information will be entered into LDAP?&nbsp; As a
rule, anything that gets saved to your Global Address Book room will
also be saved to LDAP.&nbsp; Citadel will set up OU's (Organizational
Units) for each node on your Citadel network, so if you are running
multiple Citadel servers in an organization, you will automatically
have a hierarchial view built for you.&nbsp; Below the OU's will be an
entry for each user who has a vCard registered on the system.&nbsp;
Citadel automatically translates vCard information to LDAP.<br>
<br>
If you already have a Global Address Book full of existing information,
you can execute an <span style="font-family: monospace;">IGAB</span>
(Initialize Global Address Book) server command to rebuild it.&nbsp; In
addition to performing its usual function of rebuilding the internal
Internet e-mail address mapping table, Citadel will also repopulate
LDAP with all existing vCards.&nbsp; You should be aware, however, that
existing LDAP entries will not be cleared from your directory
server.&nbsp; If your directory contains only Citadel data, you can
safely delete your database and start over, because it will be
repopulated.&nbsp; Otherwise, Citadel will merely update any existing
records with fresh information.<br>
<br>
The LDAP Connector for Citadel is a recent development, so expect more
functionality in this space in the near future.<br>

<h2><a name="utilities"></a>Utilities</h2>
</center>
<h3><a name="overview"></a>Overview</h3>
<p>The following utilities will be discussed: </p>
<ul>
  <li><b>aidepost</b> - Post standard input to the Aide&gt; room </li>
  <li><b>whobbs</b> - Who is on the system </li>
  <li><b>msgform</b> - Format a binary message to the screen (stdin or
in a file) </li>
  <li><b>userlist</b> - Print the userlist </li>
  <li><b>sendcommand</b> - Send a server command </li>
</ul>
<p>It is up to you to decide which utilities should be made accessible
only to system administrators. It is important that you set the file
permissions correctly. All utilities should have access to the Citadel
data files. We
will attempt to address each program individually.</p>
<h3><a name="aidepost"></a>aidepost</h3>
<p>The nature of this program is rather simple. Standard input (stdin)
is converted into a message, filed in the main message store, and
posted in the Aide&gt; room. This is useful for keeping transcripts of
system activity that has to do with Citadel operations. You might even
elect to send all of
your system logs there, too.</p>
<p><tt>aidepost</tt> also accepts the usage <tt>aidepost -rTargetRoom</tt>,
where TargetRoom is the name of a room to which you'd like the message
to be sent.</p>
<h3><a name="whobbs"></a>whobbs</h3>
<p>This program is similar to the <tt>who</tt> command. It lists all
of the users who are currently connected to your Citadel server, either
locally or
across a network. Unless you're running a standalone system, <tt>who</tt>
and <tt>whobbs</tt> will probably not have a one-to-one
correspondence. Remember
that you will see sessions for SMTP, POP, and IMAP users, as well as
users
running a Citadel client.</p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind is that the <tt>whobbs</tt> utility
actually opens a connection to the server. If the server is maxed out, <tt>whobbs</tt>
will still be able to provide a listing, because it doesn't need to log
in to execute the <tt>RWHO</tt> command. Note that whobbs does not
list its own session.</p>
<p>The <tt>whobbs</tt> utility is smart enough to know when it is
being invoked by a web server as a CGI program. In this situation, it
will output its listing
as a nicely formatted web page instead of plain text. This makes it
easy
to just put a link to the whobbs binary in your cgi-bin directory,
allowing
a quick and easy way for web surfers to see who is online.</p>
<p>Running the <tt><b>W</b>ho is online</tt> command from the Citadel
client does <b>not</b> call this utility. It has this functionality
built in.<br>
<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="msgform"></a>msgform</h3>
<p>The <tt>msgform</tt> utility reads its standard input (stdin)
looking for
Citadel messages stored in the internal format used on disk and over
the
network, and sends them in a human-readable format to standard output
(stdout). There is no longer much use for this program, but it is
included for hack
value.</p>
<h3><a name="userlist"></a>userlist</h3>
<p>This is a program to print the userlist. There are two flags that
may be
set when running this program. When called without any arguments, <tt>userlist</tt>
will display all users (except those who have chosen to be unlisted),
their user numbers, times called, messages posted, screen width, and
date of their most recent call.</p>
<p><tt>userlist</tt> is simply the same user listing code that is in
the
client, made into a standalone utility for convenience.<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="sendcommand"></a>sendcommand</h3>
<p><tt>sendcommand</tt> will interpret its arguments (except for <tt>-hDIRNAME</tt>)
as a server command, which is sent to the server. Commands which
require textual input will read it from stdin. Commands which generate
textual output will be sent to stdout.</p>
<p>This utility is intended to be used to enable Citadel server
commands to
be executed from shell scripts.</p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> be sure that this utility is not world-executable. It
connects to the server in privileged mode, and therefore could present
a security hole
if not properly restricted.</p>
