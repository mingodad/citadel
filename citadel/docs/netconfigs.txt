 
           Description of the files in the "netconfigs" directory

 These files contain a set of network configurations for a room.  They are
stored in the directory $CTDLDIR/netconfigs and are named according to each
room's internal ID number.  When a room is deleted, its network configuration
file is deleted as well.
  
 The configuration file contains one or more lines of text, each line
containing a configuration option.  These lines may specify message pointers,
room sharing instructions, mailing list recipients, etc.  Fields are separated
by the vertical bar character ("|") and there will always be at least one
field on each line.
  
 
 INSTRUCTION:  lastsent
 SYNTAX:       lastsent|0000000
 DESCRIPTION:
    Defines the *local* message number of the last message in this room which
we have performed outbound network processing on.  Any batch job which sends
out messages should do stuff.
 
 
 INSTRUCTION:  listrecp
 SYNTAX:       listrecp|friko@mumjiboolean.com
 DESCRIPTION:
    Defines a recipient to whom all messages in this room should be sent.  This
is used for "list serve" applications.
 
 
 INSTRUCTION:  digestrecp
 SYNTAX:       digestrecp|friko@mumjiboolean.com
 DESCRIPTION:
    Defines a recipient to whom all messages in this room should be sent.  This
is used for "list serve" applications.  The difference between listrecps and
digestrecps is that the latter will have messages embedded inside a message
sent by the listserver.  The message will appear to be sent by the room's
e-mail address instead of the sender's e-mail address.
 
 
 INSTRUCTION:  ignet_push_share
 SYNTAX:       ignet_push_share|uncnsrd
          (or) ignet_push_share|uncnsrd|Foo Bar Baz
 DESCRIPTION:
    Specifies that the second argument is the name of a neighboring node on an
IGnet (Citadel networking) network, to which this room should be pushed
(spooled).  Conceptually, this node will have a corresponding record pushing
data in the other direction.
 
    If the third argument is present, it is the name of the corresponding
room on the remote node.  This allows a room to be shared even when the room
name is different on each node.  Such a configuration *must* be configured
mutually: each node must know the name of the room on the other.
 
  
 INSTRUCTION:  subpending
 SYNTAX:       subpending|friko@mumjiboolean.com|listrecp|A234Z|1234567890|http://foo.com/lists
    "Subscription pending" for the specified address.  This means that
someone has requested to subscribe an e-mail address (in this case,
friko@mumjiboolean.com) to the list.  The third parameter is either "list"
or "digest" to specify a normal subscription or a digest subscription.
The fourth parameter is an authentication token which is generated by the server
and e-mailed to the specified address.  When the user comes back and supplies
this token, the subscription is complete.  The fifth parameter is a simple
timestamp, so that we may purge old records which were never confirmed.
 
 The sixth field is the URL of the web page used to enter the subscription
request, minus any parameters.

 
 INSTRUCTION:  unsubpending
 SYNTAX:       unsubpending|friko@mumjiboolean.com|A234Z|1234567890|http://foo.com/lists
    Similar to the 'subpending' command, except this one is for unsubscribe
requests.  The same rules apply with regard to the token and the web page.


 INSTRUCTION:  participate
 SYNTAX:       participate|list-addr@example.com
   This allows a room to be a  *subscriber* to an external mailing list
somewhere.  The room's email address should be subscribed to the list, and the
external listserv should be told "do not send me my own messages."  Any
messages which originated on Citadel (as opposed to messages which arrived via
email, such as those from the list) will be sent to the list, with the display
name of the author kept intact, but the email address changed to the address of
the room.
 
   This is somewhat finicky, which is why it is not officially supported, and
why there are no facilities in the user interface to configure it.  If you want
to use this option you are on your own.
 
 
 INSTRUCTION:  pop3client
 SYNTAX:       pop3client|hostname|username|password|keep|interval
   Periodically fetch messages from a remote POP3 account and store them in this
room.  Messages will be deleted from the remote account once successfully stored.
if Keep is set, messages won't be erased on the remote host.
Interval can specify a bigger value than the system configs value.
