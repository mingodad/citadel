Some notes on the build process...

  autodependency generation is implemented by generating a bunch of .d  
files (with another suffix rule) using $(CC) - M and "-include"-ing them 
from the main Makefile. the .d files are made to depend on the .c files 
they correspond to, and the referenced header files, so they're updated as 
needed. the only version of make that I know for sure works with this is 
GNU make, but the Makefile should still work on other versions of Unix 
make, just without the autodependency stuff.

one thing I forgot to mention about the autodependency generation: for a 
file to be included in the autodepend process, it must be listed in the 
SOURCES macro near the top of Makefile.in. 
  also, I've added an 'install' target to the makefile. this will make it  
possible to build RPM's, and bring the installation process closer to that 
of other packages, which if you're using the new configure script goes 
like this: 
  ./configure [--enable-ansi-color] [--disable-autologin] [--prefix=/foo] 
  
  --prefix specifies the location Citadel will run from,  
/usr/local/citadel by default. 
  to build a highly optimized version without debugging symbols, you could 
 do something like this (with the bourne shell): 
  CC=egcs CFLAGS='-O6 -fomit-frame-pointer' ./configure   
  after configuring, simply type `make', then su to a user who has  
appropriate permissions, and `make install'. then run setup as usual. 
  are there any other areas that need to be cleared up?
