Package builders: you can set the following environment variables
before running setup in quiet mode (setup -q) in order to keep it
quiet but still do setup.

First, please set CITADEL_INSTALLER to "yes"

Then set:

CITADEL			Directory in which Citadel is installed

SLAPD_BINARY		Location of slapd (optional)
LDAP_CONFIG		Location of slapd.conf (optional)

SUPPORT			Location of libraries, etc. (optional)
			(i.e. /usr/local/ctdlsupport)

CTDL_DIALOG		Location of the 'dialog' program (optional)

ACT_AS_MTA		When other MTA's (Postfix, etc.) are found, setup
			will offer to disable them in order to keep them
			from interfering with Citadel.  Set this variable to
			"yes" to always disable the other MTA without asking,
			or to "no" to never disable the other MTA.

CREATE_INITTAB_ENTRY	Set to "yes" to automatically create an entry in
			/etc/inittab to start the Citadel server, if needed.

CREATE_XINETD_ENTRY	Set to "yes" to automatically configure xinetd to route
			telnet connections into a Citadel client, if needed.

SYSADMIN_NAME		Name of system administrator.

NO_INIT_SCRIPTS		Set to non-null to suppress the creation of init
			scripts when running on a SysV-init based host.
