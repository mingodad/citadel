Chat subsystem information

Chat / Messaging system
-----------------------

I envision a chat system that can be used for a variety of uses, from
chatting in realtime to file exchange to slide presentations.

Rooms will be able to have invitation lists -- perfect for scheduling a
private meeting with various people around the world.

Meetings will be scheduled by the system scheduler.  The scheduler is not
part of this project -- the scheduler will do the work of determining a time
when all participants are free.  When a time is decided on, the scheduler
will call the chat subsystem which will write this schedule to a file.  This
is to make sure that if the chat subsystem is shut down for some reason, it
will remember the reserved rooms and invite lists.

Rooms
-----
I think a conference call-like system would be good.  Chat sessions can be
scheduled with a predetermined list of people or started manually and their
invite lists manually made.  Either someone is designated a conference
leader or whoever created the room is the conference leader.  The conference
leader(s) can invite new people to the room, and kick & ban people out of
the room.

Messages should be able to be sent to anyone on the bbs from the page system
to the chat system and vice versa.

This can be implemented with the current citadel clients.

Tranfers
--------
An addition that would be useful here would be the ability to send a file to
everyone in a room as well as individual users.

This cannot be implemented with the current citadel clients -- I DON'T
THINK.  I'm not sure.

Graphics transfers
------------------
The idea is to allow slides to be shown to clients.  The transfers mechanism
will be used to send the graphics so you would be able to send slides to
everyone or just one user.

This will have to be written into the client (Unix client calls xv, for
example)  

Structures
----------

/* hold the invite / ban info in this structure.  Username and host are each
 * used only if they are specified.  This allows banning all hosts from a
 * particular site.
 */

typedef struct s_chat_userlist		
{
   char username[32];
   char host[64];
   struct s_chat_userlist *next;
} chat_userlist;

typedef struct s_chat_joinlist
{
   struct CitContext *user_context;
   struct s_chat_joinlist *next;
} chat_joinlist;

/* Simple chatroom definition */

typedef struct s_chatroom
{
   char room_name[20];
   char room_password[20];
   time_t scheduled_start;
   time_t scheduled_stop;
   int room_flags;
   chat_userlist *invite_list;
   chat_userlist *ban_list;
   chat_joinlist *join_list;		/* Context's of who's in this room */
   chat_joinlist *chanops_list;		/* Context's of channel ops */
   struct s_chatroom *next;
} chatroom;


Definitions
-----------
#define CHATROOM_PRIVATE	1	/* Invite only */
#define CHATROOM_HIDDEN		2	/* Hidden from listing */
#define CHATROOM_PASSWORD	4	/* Password protected */

Schedule
--------
The stuff that can be implemented in terms of the currentl client will go
first.  The transfers will come next.
