Citadel Database Cleanup
---------------------------

This script exports, deletes, and re-imports your database.  If you have
any data corruption issues, this program may be able to clean them up for you.
 
Please note that this program does a Berkeley DB dump/load, not a Citadel
export.  The export files are not generated by the Citadel export module.

WARNING #1:
  MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR DATA BEFORE ATTEMPTING THIS.  There is no guarantee
  that this will work (in case of disk full, power failure, program crash)!

WARNING #2:
  citserver must NOT be running while you do this.

WARNING #3:
  Please try "cd $DATA_DIR; $RECOVER -c" first. Run citserver afterwards to 
  revalidate whether its fixed or not, No news might be good news. Use this
  tool only if that one fails to fix your problem.

WARNING #4:
  You must have an amount of free space on your disk that is at least twice
  the size of your database, see the following output:
  (for substantially better performance you should specify a location that is 
   on another disk than $DATA_DIR)

`df -h`

you will need `du -sh $DATA_DIR|sed "s;/.*;;"` of free space.
