To send mail on this system, go to the Mail> room (using the command .G Mail)
and press E to enter a message.  You will be prompted with:
 
 Enter Recipient:
 
   At this point you may enter the name of another user on the system.  Private
mail is only readable by the sender and recipient.  There is no need to delete
mail after it is read; it will scroll out automatically.
  
   To send mail to another user on the Citadel network, simply type the
user's name, followed by @ and then the system name. For example,
  
 Enter Recipient: Joe Schmoe @ citadrool
  
  If your account is enabled for Internet mail, you can also send email to
anyone on the Internet here.  Simply enter their address at the prompt:
  
 Enter Recipient: ajc@herring.fishnet.com
