 Floors
 ------
   Floors in Citadel are used to group rooms into related subject areas,
just as rooms are used to group messages into manageable groups.
 
   You, as a user, do NOT have to use floors.  If you choose not to, you suffer
no penalty; you will not lose access to any rooms.  You may use .EC or ;C (the
latter is easier to use) to decide if you want to use floors.  Feel free to
experiment.
 
   Floor options are accessed two ways.  First, if you are in floor mode, the
<G>oto and <S>kip commands take you to the next room with new messages on the
current floor; if there are none left, then the system will automatically
switch floors (and let you know) and put you in the first room with new messages
on that level.  (Notice that your pattern of basic use of ^variantname therefore
doesn't really change.)
 
   Direct access to floor options is via the use of a ";" command.
The following commands are currently available (more can be
added if needed):
 
 <;C>onfigure
 This command toggles your floor mode.
 
 <;G>oto FLOORNAME
 This command causes the system to take you to the named floor.
 
 <;K>nown rooms on floors
 List all rooms on all floors.  This is a very readable way to get a list of
all rooms on the system.
 
 <;S>kip FLOORNAME
 This command causes the system to mark all rooms on the current floor as
Skipped and takes you to the floor that you specify.
 
 <;Z>Forget floor
   This command causes you to forget all the rooms currently on the current
floor.  Unfortunately, it doesn't apply to rooms that are subsequently created
or moved to this floor.  (Sorry.)
 
   Feel free to experiment, you can't hurt yourself or the system with the
floor stuff unless you ZForget a floor by accident.
