Extended commands are available using the period ( . ) key. To use
a dot command, press the . key, and then enter the first letter of
each word in the command. The words will appear as you enter the keys.
You can also backspace over partially entered commands. The following
commands are available:

 <.> <H>elp:    Displays help files.  Type .H followed by a help file
                name.  You are now reading <.H>elp SUMMARY
 
 <.> <G>oto:    Jumps directly to the room you specify.  You can also
                type a partial room name, just enough to make it unique,
                and it'll find the room you're looking for.  As with the
                regular <G>oto command, messages in the current room will
                be marked as read.
 
 <.> <S>kip, goto:    This is similar to <.G>oto, except it doesn't mark
                      messages in the current room as read.
 
 <.> list <Z>apped rooms      Shows all rooms you've <Z>apped (forgotten)
