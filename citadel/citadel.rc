# 2. <compiled CTDLDIR>/citadel.rc
# 3. /etc/citadel.rc
# 4. <current directory>/citadel.rc

# Set ENCRYPT to yes to force SSL/TLS encryption when connecting to a
# Citadel server, even if the server is on the same machine as the
# client.  Set it to no to disable SSL/TLS encryption.  The default is to
# enable encryption for remote systems and to disable encryption for
# systems on the same machine as the client.
encrypt=default

# Set FULLSCREEN to yes to (attempt to) use full-screen curses mode.
# This mode presents a status line and a few other niceties.  Some
# people might not like this, so you can turn it off here or with the
# -s command line option.  The default is to use full screen if the
# terminal supports it.
fullscreen=no

# Set EDITOR to the name of an external editor to be used for entering
# messages.  If you want the external editor to be used by default, be sure
# to reflect this in the command set below.
#
# editor=vi

# Or, you could have multiple editors available, like this:
# ("editor" and "editor0" are the same internally)
# You can go up to MAX_EDITORS number of editors (5 by default)
# editor0=pico
# editor1=vi
# editor2=nano

# If you define PRINTCMD, it will be a pipe through which messages are
# printed when the user hits the <P>rint key after a message.
#
#printcmd=lpr

# If you define EXPCMD, it will be a pipe through which any incoming
# express messages will be printed.
#expcmd=xmessage -title "Express Message" -center -buttons OK -file -

# If LOCAL_SCREEN_DIMENSIONS is set to 1, then the screen dimensions will
# be requested from the underlying operating system instead of asking the
# user.  On modern networks this is almost always the case: telnet, SSH,
# xterm, and Unix/Linux consoles all properly report the screen dimensions.
# Set this option to 0 only if you are running the Citadel client on a
# direct-dial modem or hardwired terminals.
#
local_screen_dimensions=1

# ANSI_COLOR should be set to on/off/auto/user to control the use of
# color on the screen.  If it is set to "auto" then an autodetect will be
# attempted.  If it is set to "user" then it's a user-configurable option.
#
ansi_color=user

# USE_BACKGROUND controls Citadel's use of the background.  If it is turned
# off, then Citadel will set the background to black.  When it is turned on,
# the background will be unchanged.  This is most useful with "transparent"
# terminals.  Color must be on (see above) or this option has no effect.
#
use_background=off

# PROMPT_CONTROL should be set to on/off/user to control whether the <N>ext
# and <S>top keys are active when displaying the paginator prompt.  If it
# is set to "user" then it's a user-configurable option.
#
prompt_control=user

# If DISPLAY_MESSAGE_NUMBERS is set to 1, then messages will be displayed
# with their message numbers in the header.  This is ugly but some
# people seem to like it anyway...
#
display_message_numbers=0

# The FORCE_MAIL_PROMPTS directive causes mail rooms to always display a
# prompt after each message, even if the user has prompts turned off.
#
force_mail_prompts=1

# USE_FLOORS determines whether the user sees floors, or a flat room space.
# Set it to YES to always use floors, NO to never use floors, or DEFAULT
# to use the setting in the user's configuration (which is normally the case).
#
use_floors=DEFAULT

# BEEP should be set to 1 if you wish the terminal to beep when an express
# message (page) comes in, otherwise set it to 0.
#
beep=1

# ALLOW_ATTACHMENTS should be set to 1 if you wish the user to be able to
# attach files to messages and/or save attachments to disk while reading
# messages.  (DANGER: do NOT enable this for "safe" public clients!)
#
allow_attachments=0

# IDLE_THRESHOLD is the amount of time a user does nothing before being
# listed as "idle" on the who list.  The default is 900 seconds (15 minutes).
#
idle_threshold=900

# If you set REMEMBER_PASSWORDS to 1, the Citadel client will offer to
# remember your user name and password for every Citadel server you access,
# automatically logging in with them on subsequent visits. 
# (DANGER: do NOT enable this for "safe" public clients!)
#
remember_passwords=0

# Optionally, you can force the same username and password everywhere.  This
# obviously isn't as robust as the password manager.
#
#username=My User Name
#password=mypassword

# If URLCMD is defined, users can hit 'U' after reading a message which
# contains embedded URL's, and the command will be executed.  Usually this
# will be used to remote-control a web browser.  (Do not enable this command
# for 'safe' public clients.)
#
# This one ought to work on any Linux that has the "Portland" API's installed.
# If properly configured, xdg-open will open the URL in the user's perferred
# web browser.
#urlcmd=xdg-open "%s"
#
# This one works on non-Portland Linux and most other X11-based Unices.
# Specify the full path to Firefox if necessary.
#urlcmd=/usr/bin/firefox -a firefox -remote "openURL(%s)" >/dev/null 2>&1
#
# This one works really well on a Macintosh -- it opens URL's in whatever
# browser you have configured as the system default.
#urlcmd=open "%s"

# If OPENCMD is defined, users can hit 'O' after reading a message which
# contains attachments, to open the attachments using that command.  This
# allows attachments to be opened directly from the Citadel client without
# having to first save them in a file.  The "allow_attachments" option (see
# above) must be enabled in order for this to work.
# 
# xdg-open works on most newer Linux systems
opencmd=xdg-open "%s"
#
# This probably will work on a Macintosh
#opencmd=open "%s"

# If GOTMAILCMD is defined, the specified command will be executed.  This
# might be nice for playing sounds or providing any other type of notification.
#
#gotmailcmd=play gotmail.wav

# If IMAGECMD is defined, users can hit 'I' to view images attached to a
# message.  (Do not enable this command for public clients.)
#
# Possible image viewers follow

# xdg-open - on Linux systems with the Portland API's installed, this ought
# to open the image in the user's preferred viewer.
#imagecmd=xdg-open "%s"

# XV - This is an oldie but goodie, shareware with source code included, no
# longer included with some Linux distributions due to licensing.
#imagecmd=xv "%s"

# The following 2 image viewers are included with KDE:
# KuickShow has a brightness/gamma option and is simple and ubobtrusive
#imagecmd=kuickshow "%s"

# KView has no brightness/gamma but can do some minimal cropping and clipboard
# operations
#imagecmd=kview "%s"

# Eye of Gnome, the Gnome/Nautilus image viewer component (bare bones
# view/print):
#imagecmd=eog "%s"

# GIMP is a free-software attempt at a PhotoShop-like application.
#imagecmd=gimp "%s"

# Preview on Mac OS X
#imagecmd=/Applications/Preview.app/Contents/MacOS/Preview "%s"

# MESSAGE READING SEMANTICS (experimental)
#
# A new set of message reading semantics is now available.  If you set
# alternate_semantics, the following changes are made:
#
# * Messages are marked as read when you read them, rather than when you
#   leave the room.  This means read <N>ew will display a new message
#   at most once, unless last old on new is turned on.
# * Reading <F>orward or <R>everse does not mark messages as read.
# * When you leave a room with <G>oto, <J>ump, etc., only messages that
#   were in the room when you arrived are marked as read.  The original
#   semantics mark all messages read that were in the room at the time
#   you leave the room.  This occasionally causes messages to be "lost."
# * When you leave with <T>erminate, no additional messages are marked
#   as read.
# * The <S>kip and <A>bandon commands are reversed.
#
# This set of semantics should make Citadel easier to use on very busy
# systems, where many messages may be posted while reading.  Users
# accustomed to D.O.C. or its variants will want to set this option.
#
alternate_semantics=no



# COMMAND SET CONFIGURATION
#
# All lines starting with "cmd=" are considered to be commands.  This allows
# mapping of keytstrokes to various functions of the client.
#
# Format of each line:
# cmd_num,access,keystrokes
#
# Keep a copy of the original version of this file around as a reference
# for the command numbers.  They are not documented anywhere else.
#
# Access is:  0 (all users), 1 (aides or room aides), 2 (aides only).
# Please be aware that it is futile to attempt to gain unauthorized access to
# the administrative functions of the system by changing all the access levels
# to 0.  If you do this, you'll simply be able to enter a lot of commands that
# will fail at the server ... so don't bother trying. :-)
#
# The actual key to be pressed should be prefaced with an & (ampersand)
# character.  Ampersands are interesting and useful characters and you should
# use them as much as possible.  Commands requiring more than one keystroke
# should be entered as multiple fields.
#
# If the last keystroke string ends with a : (colon), then the command
# will finish by allowing the user to enter a string.
#
# In keystroke names, the string ^r will be replaced by the name of the
# current room.  The string ^c will be replaced by a comma.
#
# Commands may contain no more than five keystrokes.
#
# Note that the following characters are illegal in commands:
#  , (comma)    : (colon)     ^ (caret)     & (ampersand)
