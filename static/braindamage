# This file contains a list of browsers which are known to support
# or not support various functions.
#
# The list is parsed from the top down.  When a match is made, parsing
# immediately stops.  This implies that records at the top of the list
# take precedence over records towards the bottom.
#
# Each record must start with a key value:
# YES	= This browser implements frame sets and JavaScript compatibly
#	  enough to run WebCit in its full functionality.
# NO	= This browser is brain damaged, so WebCit must run in its
#	  non-frames, non-JavaScript mode.
# ASK	= We don't know, so ask the user.


# Look for Internet Explorer first, because the morons at Microsoft decided
# to make life difficult by calling their user-agent "Mozilla" as well, and
# put the 'MSIE' in parentheses.

# Any version of Internet Explorer earlier than 4.0 is utter trash. 
# Version 4 and 5 appear to be ok.
NO	Mozilla*MSIE 1.*
NO	Mozilla*MSIE 2.*
NO	Mozilla*MSIE 3.*
YES	Mozilla*MSIE 4.*
YES	Mozilla*MSIE 5.*


# Opera is untested, and some versions of Opera also use a user-agent string
# starting with "Mozilla" (arrgh...)
ASK	*Opera*

# Anything else starting with "Mozilla" is assumed to be a genuine
# Netscape browser.  Use the full frames/JavaScript mode starting with
# version 3.
NO	Mozilla/1.*
NO	Mozilla/2.*
YES	Mozilla/3.*
YES	Mozilla/4.*
YES	Mozilla/5.*

# Lynx is a text-mode browser.  Forget it.
NO	*Lynx*

# Konqueror (also known as kfm), the KDE browser/filemanager.  Nope.
NO	Konqueror*

# The default...
ASK	*
