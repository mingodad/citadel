	* Added "enter registration"
	* Set up automatic trigger of Enter Registration when the server
	  says it's needed
	* Established that a one-to-one WebCit/Citadel correspondence will
	  be required.  No big deal due to shared code segments.

	* Added networking configuration screens.  These still need testing.
	* Added a "kill session" link to each line of the wholist when
	  logged in as an aide, and the screens to perform this operation.

	* context_loop.c: Moved "remove session" into its own function.
	  Check for dead webcit child process before each transaction.
	* Ignore SIGPIPE; this seems to magically make the program bulletproof
	  against broken HTTP connections.
	* Added a housekeeping thread to periodically remove dead sessions
	  and kill idle sessions.
	* messages.c: added "delete message" functionality

Wed Dec  9 18:50:46 EST 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* context_loop.c: After fork(), child process closes the HTTP socket
	  so when the parent process closes it, it actually _does_ close.
	  Otherwise, aIEeeee and possibly other browsers will hang.

Tue Dec  8 15:45:42 EST 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Discovered that the HTTP socket problem is related to a socket that
	  isn't properly lingering on close.  Temporarily hacked a sleep(10)
	  into context_loop.c until it is figured out.

Mon Dec  7 17:03:18 EST 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
