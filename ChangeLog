Revision 522.13  2004/07/13 03:25:08  ajc
* inetconf.c: added.  Not finished yet.

Revision 522.12  2004/07/10 03:10:19  ajc
* Completed web screens for THE DREADED AUTO-PURGER by adding room and
  floor level configurations.
* Put a space between OK and CANCEL buttons anywhere in the system where
  there wasn't one.
* Some more of the room config/admin screens now return to themselves
  with a "ok, you did that" message when OK is pressed, instead of dropping
  out to the main menu.

Revision 522.11  2004/07/08 03:03:01  ajc
* Added global settings for THE DREADED AUTO-PURGER to the site-wide
  configuration (public rooms default and mailboxes default).  Still need
  to add floor and room policy screens.

Revision 522.10  2004/07/02 03:28:08  ajc
* Much-improved alphabet tabs for Address Book view.  Now divides the
  total number of names by (names per page, currently 60) and sets up
  that many tabs, with proper [Aaa-Bbb] labels on them.

Revision 522.9  2004/07/02 03:26:06  ajc
*** empty log message ***

Revision 522.8  2004/07/01 02:40:40  ajc
* Clicking "Enter a message" in a groupware room now automatically calls
  the correct editor for the type of objects in the room (message, calendar
  event, task, address book entry)

Revision 522.7  2004/06/29 17:21:25  ajc
* Removed the word "room" in a few locations, as part of our push towards
  not looking like a BBS when running in groupware mode

Revision 522.6  2004/06/29 00:37:02  ajc
* Made some fonts bigger because users were complaining...

Revision 522.5  2004/06/27 03:02:05  ajc

* Summary view -- new messages are in boldface

Revision 522.4  2004/06/24 20:42:14  ajc
* Added the "server ip address" Citadel config option
* Site config: added "Changes will not take effect until..." language
  to relevant screens

Revision 522.2  2004/06/22 02:21:56  ajc

Revision 522.1  2004/06/21 15:00:52  ajc
* minor CSS changes

Revision 522.0  2004/06/19 03:21:35  ajc
* THIS IS 5.22

Revision 521.10  2004/06/19 03:11:07  ajc
* Instead of a crufty "the topmost Internet email address will be used
  for outgoing email" explanation, separated it into "Primary Internet
  email address" and "Other email addresses" boxes.

Revision 521.9  2004/06/19 02:42:12  ajc
* Removed the "aides access to mailboxes" config option, which is no longer
  part of the Citadel system.

Revision 521.8  2004/06/16 02:07:22  ajc
* Removed a couple of lines of debugging code leftover from last night

Revision 521.7  2004/06/15 03:06:11  ajc
* Bumped internal version number to 5.22
* Use new fast headers-only-no-mime fetch mode in Citadel for
  message summaries

Revision 521.6  2004/06/15 02:30:21  ajc
* Honor "maxmsgs" even when viewing a mailbox in summary mode

Revision 521.5  2004/06/12 04:26:38  ajc
* Fixed some garbled output resulting from turning things that look like
  links into links

Revision 521.4  2004/06/11 16:09:36  ajc
* Moved the room graphic to the left of the room name in the banner, to
  make it more consistent with the rest of the site.
* Reduced the size of the font in the iconbar

Revision 521.3  2004/06/11 03:15:08  ajc
* When "Add" is clicked without specifying an upload filename, resume
  composition instead of aborting the post.
* Add attachments to messages in forward order, not reverse order

Revision 521.2  2004/06/10 03:08:48  ajc
* Improved the appearance of tabs in the room config screen

Revision 521.1  2004/06/10 02:58:55  ajc
* Made all the title boxes the same background color.  The old scheme was
  cute but not professional looking.

Revision 521.0  2004/06/06 19:53:25  ajc
* THIS IS 5.21

Revision 510.15  2004/06/06 19:32:15  ajc
* Cleaned up a couple of FIXME's sitting around in the code
* Altered the conditions under which stray http://... strings are
  automatically turned into links, to prevent that logic from
  transforming IMG tags into gibberish.
* Set internal version number to 5.21

Revision 510.14  2004/06/04 02:29:07  ajc
* Fixed bug in "validate new users" screen (thanks Campy)

* "Reply" button now carries the message subject into the reply.

Revision 510.12  2004/06/02 02:07:54  ajc
* setup.c: updated the setup script to configure two /etc/inittab entries,
  one for http and one for https.

Revision 510.11  2004/06/01 21:46:47  ajc
* crypto.c: when an SSL connection errors out (and closes) unexpectedly
  during a read or write operation, do not attempt to finish the operation
  unencrypted like we do in Citadel.  Here in WebCit land it only causes
  the server to segfault.

Revision 510.10  2004/06/01 19:01:22  ajc
* netconf.c: widened some of the text entry fields
* webcit.h: bumped up the internal version number to 5.20

Revision 510.9  2004/06/01 18:44:20  ajc
* Return to the old command-line usage (-s for https, service is either
  http or https but not both)

Revision 510.8  2004/06/01 03:32:28  ajc
* Add "permanent room" setting to room edit screen
* create room -- allow longer strings

Revision 510.7  2004/06/01 00:36:43  ajc
* Hmmph.  Do the session cookie as hex instead of base64.  There really
  are some characters in the base64 set that make HTTP do nasty things.

Revision 510.6  2004/05/31 21:43:27  ajc
* Added "|END" to the session cookie before base64-ing it.  This fixes a
  problem with certain room names causing the webserver to freak out and
  break embedded images and stuff.  I don't know why.

Revision 510.5  2004/05/31 20:34:11  ajc
* Message entry using Kevin Roth's excellent cross-platform richtext
  editing script.

Revision 510.4  2004/05/31 15:54:13  ajc
* "text" and "HTML" options for message entry.

Revision 510.3  2004/05/29 03:31:48  ajc
* tighten up the space between icons in the iconbar

* Updated documentation for the new HTTPS service

Revision 506.12  2004/04/27 03:21:36  ajc
* Prompt for HTTPS port number during setup.  We may make this optional.

Revision 506.11  2004/04/27 03:16:31  ajc
* When running on the same host as Citadel, if no key/cert are found,
  symlink to Citadel's if possible.
* One server binary now forks to start both http and https servers.

Revision 506.10  2004/04/21 03:43:39  ajc
* Completed remaining SSL fixes.  Works in Moz, aIEeee, Konq; self-signed
  certs are also no longer invalid.

Revision 506.9  2004/04/21 02:25:13  ajc
* Replaced ctdl_install_certificate() with convenience functions found
  in the OpenSSL library.

Revision 506.8  2004/04/21 02:19:41  ajc
* Got HTTPS to work with Mozilla (by twiddling stuff that I still don't
  understand, but read at http://www.informit.com/articles/article.asp?p=22078
  ).  Still doesn't work with Internet Monopolizer, though.

Revision 506.7  2004/04/20 02:32:44  ajc
* Allow setup to run seamlessly from within the Citadel/UX Ridiculously
  Easy Installer by observing the values of environment variables
  CITADEL_INSTALLER, CITADEL, and WEBCIT.

Revision 506.6  2004/04/20 02:02:50  ajc
* "make install"

Revision 506.5  2004/04/16 03:14:06  ajc
* Minor fix for previous checkin

Revision 506.4  2004/04/16 02:59:01  ajc
* Completed SSL support.  Still doesn't work with all browsers... gotta
  figure out why

Revision 506.3  2004/04/15 03:57:00  ajc
* Brought over the SSL/TLS stuff from Citadel.  I think it's complete but
  it has a crashy crashy bug in it.  Don't use it yet.

Revision 506.2  2004/04/13 19:41:36  ajc
* GET /freebusy/user.vcf *and* /freebusy/user.vfb now both work.
  (freebusy data fetch for anonymous Kolab type clients)

Revision 506.1  2004/04/10 04:32:59  ajc
* Fixed some version and copyright date oopses

Revision 506.0  2004/04/10 04:29:30  ajc

* configure.in, Makefile.in: handle $LDFLAGS

Revision 505.20  2004/03/20 05:03:14  ajc
* Original startup thread becomes a worker thread after initialization.
  Doing otherwise turns it into a zombie (at least on Linux) and possibly
  leads to other problems
* Filter out NOOP's received in chat

Revision 505.19  2004/03/18 04:32:24  ajc
* Removed the language in README.TXT which told everyone that chat wouldn't
  work with a non-local Citadel server, because that's no longer true.
* Removed the old chat applet from the static/ directory

Revision 505.18  2004/03/18 04:00:44  ajc
* Rounded web boxes now look correct in all browsers.

Revision 505.17  2004/03/17 18:25:31  ajc
* When creating a new user, auto-chain to the "edit user configuration"
  screen, and subsequently auto-chain to the "edit address book entry"
  screen.  This creates a nice sensible workflow.

Revision 505.16  2004/03/15 22:47:09  ajc
* Prettied up the chat window a little more.

Revision 505.15  2004/03/15 04:27:44  ajc

Revision 505.13  2004/03/07 22:04:32  ajc
* Fix the current view not being set to the default view for the creator
  of a room.

Revision 505.12  2004/03/07 21:31:17  ajc
* serv_read() now zeroes out the supplied buffer (with the supplied
  length) if a server read fails.  This causes serv_gets() to return
  instead of looping endlessly.  Fixes chat problem found on linux-ppc.

Revision 505.11  2004/03/03 05:21:36  ajc
* Made the chat screen totally kick-ass sweet.  The flickering reload
  i-frame is now tiny and hidden, and it *appends* new chat data to
  the viewable window using JavaScript.  No flickering + scrollback!
* Added a help button to the chat screen.

Revision 505.10  2004/02/29 22:52:15  ajc
* Close and clear (set to -1) server socket handle when socket errors are
  detected.  Fixes a chat problem reported by Winzlo.

* Fixed a problem that made WebCit go to the "no cookies" screen instead
  of the logout banner.
* Ford's latest stupid room has a name with more than 64 characters, and
  we still had a 64-byte room name in the march_list struct.  ooooops...

Revision 505.6  2004/02/26 03:07:26  ajc
* Put the /favicon.ico --> /static/favicon.ico hack back in.  Why not?

Revision 505.5  2004/02/25 23:10:28  ajc
* Allow "/do_logout" as a no-frames page

Revision 505.4  2004/02/25 23:00:21  ajc

  to make life easier.  (Thanks to prosthetik for this)

Revision 505.3  2004/02/25 15:20:11  ajc
* Support for favicon.ico in the static/ directory

Revision 505.2  2004/02/24 04:06:42  ajc
* Changed the colors slightly in chat screen

* Replaced the Java chat with a new system based on IFRAME's and JavaScript

Revision 505.0  2004/02/19 03:32:50  ajc
* THIS IS 5.05

Revision 504.7  2004/02/19 03:32:38  ajc
* Changed the internal version number to 5.05
* Completed the frames fix

Revision 504.6  2004/02/18 20:08:29  ajc
* Fixed the frameset force reload logic.  Now it does the whole frameset
  without displaying an error in the main frame.

Revision 504.5  2004/02/18 19:17:51  ajc
* Force reload of frameset if someone tries to escape it.  Not perfect
  but it mostly works at this poing.

Revision 504.4  2004/02/17 03:37:11  ajc
* Indicate to Citadel that we want Server Generated Invitations when
  calendar events are saved.  (No longer the default in Citadel server.)

Revision 504.3  2004/02/09 04:49:32  ajc
* Prepare for a way to avoid falling out of the main frameset

Revision 504.2  2004/02/09 03:37:57  ajc
* Changed the thread pool management algorithm.  Detecting idle time between
  socket accepts was not working reliably on all systems, so we now follow
  the same algorithm as the Citadel server (spawn more threads when number
  of sessions < number of threads, but keep constrained to pre-defined
  minimum and maximum thread count)

Revision 504.1  2004/02/03 03:09:51  ajc

Revision 503.0  2004/01/28 04:31:31  ajc

* Clicking "Enter Message" in a room with an Address Book view opens
  a blank vCard entry screen.

* Finished prettying up the vCard display

Revision 500.28  2003/10/17 02:31:45  ajc
* Multi-line string literals are deprecated in GCC 3.1 unless each line
  is wrapped in quotes.  Performed this fix so it'll compile.
* setup.c: removed references to unused variable tempfile[]

Revision 500.27  2003/10/09 03:17:02  ajc
* Started prettying up the vCard display.

Revision 500.26  2003/10/08 02:33:49  ajc
* Begin work on better handling of vCard display

Revision 500.25  2003/09/04 03:41:27  ajc
* siteconfig.c: changed some config items to drop-down boxes

Revision 500.24  2003/08/27 04:26:54  ajc
* Split the site configuration screen up into four different screens,
  and added a meta-menu

Revision 500.23  2003/08/24 03:31:50  ajc
* Finished the setup program
* Bumped the internal version number to 5.01

Revision 500.22  2003/08/22 00:47:27  ajc
* setup is now working, but it still needs a way to detect a running WebCit

Revision 500.21  2003/08/22 00:25:40  ajc
* Added a skeleton "setup" program to the tree.  It does not work yet.

Revision 500.20  2003/08/20 03:48:55  ajc

* Minimum required Citadel is now 6.11

  instead shows the letter indices across the top
* Clicking on an address in a vCard now connects to WebCit mail instead
  of a browser mailto: link

Revision 500.18  2003/08/19 04:18:43  ajc
* Changed things around in the address book view.  Made it sorted and
  more clickable and better looking...

Revision 500.17  2003/08/12 18:54:03  error
* messages.c: fix off-by-one-error in selector bar

Revision 500.16  2003/08/07 22:18:03  ajc
* Add the Summary Page to the customizable iconbar

Revision 500.15  2003/08/07 03:51:51  ajc
* Customizable icon bar as: pictures and text, pictures, text

Revision 500.14  2003/08/05 03:52:14  ajc
* First working version of the customizable iconbar.  It contains a basic
  set of options and now automatically refreshes when it's customized.

Revision 500.13  2003/08/04 03:50:29  ajc
* First cut at the customizable iconbar is done.  A bunch of generic options
  are there.  Still need to get the actual iconbar to refresh when changes
  are made.

Revision 500.12  2003/08/03 21:02:01  ajc

* When converting "anything that looks like a URL" to a real link, first
  make sure that it isn't already inside a link.  This fixes most of the
  long, ugly URL strings sent by eBay.
* Automatically dismantle mailto: links in HTML messages, and convert
  them to WebCit mail links (clicking on it sends the user to the Mail
  room and begins composing a new message with the recipient and subject
  fields pre-populated).

Revision 500.8  2003/06/29 20:51:21  ajc
* Worked around a rendering bug in Satan's Browser that was causing it
  to draw the calendar month view much wider than the actual screen wdith

Revision 500.7  2003/06/28 04:09:37  error
* roomops.c: Backout change to display one less box in the first column in
  roomlist view, it doesn't seem to work for everyone

Revision 500.6  2003/06/28 03:52:51  error
* Don't tell browsers not to cache static documents

Revision 500.5  2003/06/28 03:35:23  error
* roomops.c: Display one less floor in the first column in romlist view

Revision 500.4  2003/06/26 03:37:58  ajc
* Allow anonymous HTTP requests for /freebusy/user%20name.vcf (or .vfb)
  This will allow some groupware clients to browse the free/busy times of
  other users on the system.

Revision 500.3  2003/06/21 05:17:21  ajc
* Better alignment of system messages
* Exterminated display_error() and replaced it with WC->ImportantMessage
  which is displayed in a bubble on top of whatever page you're on next.
* Small cosmetic changes
* Fixed some nesting problems in output_headers()

Revision 500.2  2003/06/20 03:39:27  ajc
* Optimization to floor layout in box view

Revision 500.1  2003/06/20 03:04:26  ajc
* "Reply" button on messages now handles IGnet recipients correctly

Revision 500.0  2003/06/10 04:23:08  ajc
* THIS IS 5.00

Revision 410.50  2003/06/10 04:22:58  ajc
* Updated docs and headers for 5.00 release

Revision 410.49  2003/06/10 04:05:23  ajc
* De-tabled the left side icon bar and reduced one of the graphics, so
  that all of the rounded corners show up in Satan's Browser.

Revision 410.48  2003/06/10 03:47:41  ajc
* style.css: added font selection to default <BODY> tag

Revision 410.47  2003/06/06 03:26:03  ajc
* Satan's Browser insists on putting bloody acres of whitespace to the
  right of any bulleted list items, making any multi-column table containing
  a list take more than the entire screen.  Removed all such lists so it
  looks ok.  If you are reading this and you are a Microsoft employee, please
  commit suicide before you break anything else.

Revision 410.46  2003/06/06 02:22:07  ajc
* Changed the upper left and upper right bounded box corners to a solid
  blue (#204B78) instead of gradiated, because it was looking funny in
  256-color mode.  It also looked funny in Internet Explorer, but people
  who use Internet Explorer are contributing to terrorism and really don't
  deserve Web access in the first place.  So I really just fixed this to make
  it look good in 256-color Netscape.

Revision 410.45  2003/06/05 21:37:37  ajc
* Cosmetic changes.  Attempting to fix b0rken rendering of main menu
  in b0rken IE browser.  Die, Bill, Die.

Revision 410.44  2003/06/05 03:52:29  ajc
* Buncha cosmetic changes

Revision 410.43  2003/06/04 03:41:25  ajc
* Change the appearance of rooms with and without new messages in the
  room list -- now defined using CSS

Revision 410.42  2003/06/03 03:57:42  ajc
* Tightened up the room banner a bit.  Smaller padding, smaller font,
  smaller images.

Revision 410.41  2003/05/31 21:36:45  ajc
* Cosmetic changes

Revision 410.40  2003/05/26 21:05:42  ajc
* availability.c: brought over ical_ctdl_is_overlap() from Citadel.  Used
  it to complete the free/busy checking for attendee availability.

Revision 410.39  2003/05/26 05:44:45  ajc
* event.c: fix compiler warning

Revision 410.38  2003/05/26 05:39:46  ajc
* webcit.h: change minimum required Citadel server to 6.07 due to FREEBUSY
  bug fixed in Citadel.

Revision 410.37  2003/05/26 05:28:13  ajc
* serv_func.c: added utility function read_server_text()
* availability.c: banged out more of this code -- still not complete

Revision 410.36  2003/05/26 03:28:02  ajc
* Getting closer to doing the availability check.  Created new source
  module 'availability.c' for this purpose.  Stub function is in place.

Revision 410.35  2003/05/25 04:25:12  ajc
* siteconfig.c: fixed a spelling error
* event.c: add a "Check attendee availability" button, and the code to
  bypass saving the event to the server, do something with it, and then
  feed the twiddled data structure back to the form display function for
  further editing.  What's still missing is the code to do the actual
  availability check.

Revision 410.34  2003/05/24 22:22:35  ajc
* Small stylesheet hack to make it work with b0rken IE

Revision 410.33  2003/05/24 22:13:08  ajc

* summary.c: eliminate compiler warnings about unused variables when
  compiling a WebCit service without calendar support

Revision 410.30  2003/05/18 02:05:33  ajc
* More conversion of screens to the new look-and-feel.

Revision 410.29  2003/05/16 04:11:29  ajc
* We don't need no steenking workaround.  Problem fixed.  MIME parser not
  broken.  Web server was calling it with bad parameters.  All fixed now.
* Slightly tweaked the look of the tabs in the room edit screen.  Still looks
  like crap.

Revision 410.28  2003/05/15 04:52:26  ajc
* Minor workaround in web forms to handle mime parser problem in uploads

Revision 410.27  2003/05/15 03:35:59  ajc
* look and feel overhaul -- almost done!

Revision 410.26  2003/05/14 03:46:35  ajc
* More background cleanup

Revision 410.25  2003/05/05 17:19:46  ajc
* Cleanups to summary page when running on a non ical enabled system
* Use non breaking spaces in summary page box titles

Revision 410.24  2003/05/04 04:22:41  ajc
* Display body of messages on a white background.  I am doing this in order
  to prepare for making the general background of the screen a darker color.

Revision 410.23  2003/05/04 02:54:55  ajc
* Summary page now uses our cutesy new rounded window boxes

Revision 410.22  2003/05/03 21:28:41  ajc
* Added in a slick new box style and put the room lists in it

Revision 410.21  2003/05/03 16:57:04  ajc
* In the 'folders' and 'portal' views, change the folder delimiter
  from / to \ to avoid conflict with room names that have slashes

Revision 410.20  2003/05/03 16:23:29  ajc
* Enforce three columns in portal view of room list

Revision 410.19  2003/05/03 04:52:32  ajc
* Added an experimental new "portal view" to the room list options

Revision 410.18  2003/05/02 03:23:41  ajc
* Minor change to room list algorithm

Revision 410.17  2003/05/01 15:33:05  ajc
* Fixed a potential memory leak in enumeration of MIME parts

Revision 410.16  2003/05/01 03:11:35  ajc
* When static content is requested, fetch it without trying to connect
  to Citadel first.

Revision 410.15  2003/04/30 05:00:00  ajc
* Added the ability to compose messages with file attachments uploaded from
  the browser

Revision 410.14  2003/04/27 04:46:02  ajc
* Replace LKRN/LKRO in "folders view" room list with a single LKRA that
  observes the flag designating the presence of new messages.  (The "rooms
  view" uses an LKRN/LKRO pair *per floor* and has the same inefficiency,
  but that view may get axed soon.)

Revision 410.13  2003/04/26 21:57:53  ajc
* tcp_sockets.c: when an outgoing socket connection fails, close the socket
  before returning an error code to avoid a file descriptor leak

Revision 410.12  2003/04/19 21:42:36  ajc
* Repaired all my b0rken COLOR tags
* Replaced most FONT tags with SPAN tags
* Added new styles

Revision 410.11  2003/04/19 19:58:10  ajc
* Lots of great changes from Nick to make the site CSS-enabled.

Revision 410.10  2003/04/14 04:04:40  ajc
* First cut of CSS-izing WebCit.  Probably b0rken.

Revision 410.9  2003/04/09 04:02:32  ajc
* Remove the defaulthost/defaultport vs. c_host/c_port stuff -- we haven't
  supported the idea of one WebCit connecting to multiple Citadels for a
  long time.  Now it's just one set of variables, called ctdlhost/ctdlport.
* When connecting to Citadel through a Unix domain socket, don't try to make
  the Java chat applet available.

Revision 410.8  2003/03/31 03:32:19  ajc
* messages.c: check for 000 terminator while parsing RFC822 headers to
  prevent getting hung up while displaying certain badly formatted messages.

Revision 410.7  2003/03/30 06:13:19  ajc
* When reading from the server, do not treat CR as end-of-line because
  there's probably an LF coming after it.  Instead, keep reading to the LF
  and then strip both.
* Do not underline links in the icon bars

Revision 410.6  2003/03/17 04:17:41  ajc
* Call to accept() was being made with an uninitialized variable for the
  third argument.  Changed the second and third argument to NULL and 0 because
  we don't really need accept() to fill up a buffer full of information that
  we'll never use.  (Thanks to SteveV for reporting the bug and helping to
  troubleshoot it.)
* Removed the mutex wrapper around select() because we don't need it.  All
  idle worker threads now block on select() and one of them will wake up when
  a connection arrives.

Revision 410.5  2003/03/15 20:55:03  ajc
* When a requested image is not available on the Citadel server, send a
  1x1 transparent GIF instead of 404 error.

Revision 410.4  2003/03/14 04:21:57  ajc
* clone events to be encapsulated before saving, because the original
  instance may already have a parent, and that makes crashy crashy

Revision 410.3  2003/03/13 05:57:17  ajc
* More encapsulation.  Warning: there are bugs in this!!

Revision 410.2  2003/03/13 05:20:23  ajc
* Various changes to the calendar service to handle messages containing
  fully encapsulated VCALENDAR components instead of only unencapsulated
  VEVENT subcomponents.  We have to move in this direction for compatibility
  with other products.

Revision 410.1  2003/03/01 22:07:19  ajc
* New user registration, as well as existing user re-registration, now
  uses the vCard editing screen.
* Administratively editing users' address book entries now works again,
  mainly due to a fix in the Citadel server.  Now requiring Citadel 6.06
  in order to enforce this.

Revision 410.0  2003/02/19 03:49:33  ajc
* THIS IS 4.10

Revision 400.90  2003/02/19 03:49:17  ajc
* latest config.guess and config.sub from www.gnu.org

Revision 400.89  2003/02/07 04:44:17  ajc
* Replaced sleep() with a function that sleeps using select() in order to
  avoid potential issues with SIGALRM.  Possible fix for weird behavior
  when running on a Macintosh.

Revision 400.88  2003/01/29 22:32:07  ajc
* Shuffled some code and comments around; minor cleanup

Revision 400.87  2003/01/28 15:37:12  ajc
* All functions which read binary data from the server now make use of the
  read_server_binary() function in tools.c
* Binary reads from server now have safety code to prevent infinite loops
* All output of MIME objects is now done with http_transmit_thing()

Revision 400.86  2003/01/19 06:28:04  ajc
* Minimum required Citadel version 6.05

Revision 400.85  2003/01/16 04:41:26  ajc
* When displaying edit controls for time of day in the calendar, only show
  minutes that are multiples of 5 ... unless the existing value is not a
  multiple of 5, in which case we show that too.

Revision 400.84  2003/01/15 17:34:04  ajc
* event.c: fixed a misspelling
* config.guess, config.sub: updated using latest from ftp.gnu.org

Revision 400.83  2003/01/14 04:21:27  ajc
* Only offer views which make sense for the default view of a room

Revision 400.82  2003/01/13 03:34:33  ajc

Revision 400.80  2003/01/07 04:56:17  ajc
* Complete the free/busy transparency handling in the form
* Default times for new events are now in the correct timezone

Revision 400.79  2003/01/06 18:01:35  ajc

  busy (not finished).

Revision 400.78  2003/01/05 21:02:14  ajc
* Summary page: three columns are now all the same width

Revision 400.77  2003/01/05 20:56:05  ajc
* minor fix for previous checkin

Revision 400.76  2003/01/05 20:51:01  ajc

* Add "Tasks" to the summary page

Revision 400.73  2002/12/28 05:44:09  ajc
* ical_dezonify.c: brought over new version from the Citadel source (again)

Revision 400.72  2002/12/28 05:12:45  ajc
* ical_dezonify.c: brought over new version from the Citadel source.

Revision 400.71  2002/12/26 04:04:48  ajc
* Perform CHEK command when automatically establishing sessions, not just
  when one is explicitly created.  Some stuff is missing otherwise.

Revision 400.70  2002/12/25 23:18:06  ajc
* Be more strategic about when to call ical_dezonify()
  (This may be the last set of fixes.  I hope so.)

Revision 400.69  2002/12/25 21:39:38  ajc
* ical_dezonify.c: added.
* calendar.c: convert incoming ical messages to UTC
  (the usual routines will then convert them to local time for display)

Revision 400.68  2002/12/25 07:06:00  ajc
* Tweaked the code to work with libical 0.24

Revision 400.67  2002/12/20 04:50:00  ajc
* When saving a calendar event, increment the SEQUENCE property.

Revision 400.66  2002/12/18 05:03:39  ajc
* In the calendar code, changed all "struct tm *" to "struct tm" and changed
  all "tm = localtime(foo)" to "memcpy(&tm, localtime(foo), sizeof(struct tm))"
  Because the libc-allocated buffer was getting clobbered.
* This fixes the problem fleeb reported with Feb 1 events making it go nuts.

Revision 400.65  2002/12/17 05:01:39  ajc
* Prettied up the calendar day view layout
* Hour/minute editing fields now use am/pm hours and 2-digit minutes

Revision 400.64  2002/12/16 04:43:30  ajc
* Correctly handle local time zone when figuring out which day and time to
  display events on calendar month/day views.  This also seems to have
  fixed the bug that was causing events to sometimes get lost when saved.

Revision 400.63  2002/12/15 05:50:59  ajc
* Form editing of date/time fields now assumes that the icaltimetype being
  manipulated is in UTC.  It converts to/from local time for editing.

Revision 400.62  2002/12/10 23:25:47  ajc
* Display attendees in message view of calendar objects

Revision 400.61  2002/12/07 22:12:59  ajc
* Handle incoming RSVP's for meetings.  (Note: this will not actually work
  until I implement the Citadel server function which it calls.)

Revision 400.60  2002/11/30 21:34:51  ajc
* Submit organizer in a hidden field, in case the server needs it

Revision 400.59  2002/11/30 04:46:46  ajc

  (Actual invitations should be sent by the Citadel server)

Revision 400.58  2002/11/29 23:56:19  ajc
* Completed "me as organizer" -- the user's own e-mail address is inserted
  as the organizer of new events.  Detect when the user is the organizer and
  enable/disable the attendees box accordingly.

Revision 400.57  2002/11/29 16:38:37  ajc
* Started some "me as organizer" stuff.  (BROKEN BUILD ... I'll fix soon.)

Revision 400.56  2002/11/28 06:03:24  ajc
* Issue an ISME command when editing an event, to determine whether the user
  viewing the event is the organizer.  (Will use this later to allow/disallow
  sending out invitations.)

Revision 400.55  2002/11/26 05:01:04  ajc
* Began handling attendee fields

Revision 400.54  2002/11/16 23:40:11  ajc

  with the shadebox.

Revision 400.52  2002/11/16 05:40:54  ajc
* When adding new events to the calendar, default to the month [and day]
  currently being viewed.
* Hotlink each hour of the day view to an add-new-event for that day/hour.

Revision 400.51  2002/11/15 05:05:47  ajc
* Put in back/forward (yesterday/tomorrow) links in calendar day view

Revision 400.50  2002/11/15 04:11:46  ajc
* Added even more nifty JavaScript to cause the hour/minute and end date
  fields of a calendar event form to render as disabled when the "all day
  event" box is checked -- not just when the user checks the box, but also
  when the box begins its life already checked.

Revision 400.49  2002/11/14 04:59:40  ajc
* Correctly serialize and save all day events using date instead of date/time

Revision 400.48  2002/11/13 04:49:23  ajc
* "All day event" shows as a single checkbox, instead of one for the start
  time and one for the end time.  Added nifty JavaScript to zero and shade
  the hour/minute and all end time fields when all-day-event is checked.

Revision 400.47  2002/11/12 05:57:27  ajc
* Display a nicer looking screen when replying to calendar invitations
* When displaying day view, don't show all day events twice
* Day or month view: denote all day events by displaying them inside
  a grey box.

* Tell the user about broken Citadel server connections instead of
  simply printing "Goodbye"

Revision 400.45  2002/10/23 04:11:38  ajc

* After saving a VEVENT, return to the correct calendar view and date

Revision 400.27  2002/09/27 17:15:44  ajc
* Removed the gzip compression stuff due to bugs in Internet Explorer.

Revision 400.26  2002/09/27 04:37:21  ajc
* New, buggy versions of event editing screens

Revision 400.25  2002/09/26 22:00:16  ajc
* Fixed buggy month-selection algorithm (January is month 0 in 'struct tm' but
  month 1 in libical functions)

Revision 400.24  2002/09/25 21:57:13  ajc
* Keep track of msgnums in the two-pass calendar loop, so we can hotlink to
  individual items

Revision 400.23  2002/09/24 04:12:34  ajc
* Rough cut of the two-pass calendar display routines (first pass: go thru
  messages gathering VEVENT items; second pass: render calendar with data)

Revision 400.22  2002/09/23 04:01:33  ajc
* Presentation changes to calendar month view

Revision 400.21  2002/09/22 05:20:27  ajc

* display VTODO parameters

Revision 400.16  2002/09/17 04:21:00  ajc
* Handler chains for VCALENDAR and VTODO types

Revision 400.15  2002/09/17 03:37:10  ajc
* Implemented a 'display handler' infrastructure for various groupware types

Revision 400.14  2002/09/16 03:35:12  ajc
* Just a bunch of glue code to iterate through the various types of ical
  objects we could encounter

Revision 400.13  2002/09/15 04:05:41  ajc
* Process calendar object subcomponents

Revision 400.12  2002/09/15 03:40:13  ajc
* calendar.c: added
* When a text/calendar MIME type is discovered in a message, send it to
  the (currently skeleton) parser in calendar.c
* calendar.c: skeleton parser for calendar objects which currently just
  creates an icalcomponent object and frees it.

Revision 400.11  2002/09/15 03:16:24  ajc
* Changed decode_base64() to CtdlDecodeBase64() to avoid conflict with
  function namespace in libical

Revision 400.10  2002/09/15 02:50:55  ajc
* Duh.  I don't need to twiddle CFLAGS when autoconf provides -DHAVE_ZLIB_H

Revision 400.9  2002/09/14 21:33:31  ajc
* Backed out compression of inlines -- not all browsers appear to handle it

Revision 400.8  2002/09/14 20:20:29  ajc
* Attempting to push more stuff through compression.  I've introduced some
  sort of deadlock bug that I can't seem to find yet...

Revision 400.7  2002/09/14 20:00:22  ajc
* Compress output_image() graphics

Revision 400.6  2002/09/14 16:26:35  ajc
* output_image() now reads the entire image from Citadel into a buffer before
  sending it to the browser (for performance reasons, and so it can compress)

Revision 400.5  2002/09/14 04:52:59  ajc
* Look for the "libical" calendaring library and link it in if present...

Revision 400.4  2002/09/14 04:02:36  ajc
* Finished gzip compression of dynamic pages (when browser supports it)

Revision 400.3  2002/09/13 20:40:53  ajc

Revision 301.6  2001/08/22 16:38:06  ajc

Revision 211.14  2000/04/15 15:43:46  nbryant
* warning fix for 64-bit compile on ultrasparc. (kids don't try this at home,

Revision 1.111  1999/12/03 17:59:53  ajc
* BROKEN BUILD.  Wrote most of the session removal code, but some of it is

* Minor bug fix in registration screen

Revision 1.101  1999/10/06 02:44:02  ajc
* Per Nick's request, removed the key bindings stuff.  He knows how to fit
  it back in when it's fixed.  Also added more attempts at cache disabling,
  but it still doesn't work in the StarOffice browser.  I don't know why.

Revision 1.100  1999/10/02 03:26:14  ajc
* Merged in Nick's bit of JavaScript to handle key commands.
  BROKEN BUILD ALERT!!  This runs all the time, even when the cursor is
  in a text field.  Right now you can't even log in.

Revision 1.99  1999/09/01 01:06:11  ajc
* Added "max message length" field in global config screen

Sat Jul 10 17:51:39 EDT 1999 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Recompiled the Java chat applet using a genuine JDK 1.0.2

Mon May 10 23:09:34 EDT 1999 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Replaced _most_ gotoroom() calls with smart_goto(), a version
	  which can differentiate the needs of frames and noframes modes

Sat May  8 01:07:06 EDT 1999 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* webserver.c: added "-t" option to send traces somewhere else

Tue Apr 27 23:36:35 EDT 1999 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* context_loop.c: display an error page if the client browser
	  requests a non-root page and there is no cookie set
	* webserver.c: took my name off the copyright notice (it's a group

	in urls so GOTOs and User Profiles work when the string has a
	space in it.

Wed Apr 14 17:56:18 EDT 1999 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	http://www.webreference.com/dhtml/column18/menuFrLoad.html
	How to cause "onLoad=" to cause a sibling frame to refresh without
	having to use the nonportable HTTP "Window-Target:" directive.  Began
	implementation of this; it should allow portable NS/IE compatibility.

Wed Apr  7 21:51:33 EDT 1999 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Implemented "access level required to create rooms"

Thu Mar 18 00:23:05 EST 1999 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* webcit.c: modified getz() to *exit* the program when fgets()
	  returns an error.  This is actually the desired behavior; it would
	  otherwise busy-loop forever on a broken pipe.

Sat Mar  6 19:56:07 EST 1999 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* webcit.c: added to getz() the ability to return an error code;
	  implemented this in the main loop, hopefully fixing problems

1999-02-24 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* context_loop.c: warning fix
	* webcit.c: off_t is a 64-bit `long long' on BSDI (eek!)

Sat Jan 30 19:00:58 EST 1999 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Resolve the name of the connecting host and pass it on to Citadel

Fri Jan 29 14:49:49 EST 1999 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* wDumpContent() is now responsible for </BODY></HTML> most of the
	  time (parameter settable) so that the main menu can easily be
	  embedded in every page when running in noframes mode
	* noframes mode selection is now carried in the cookie

Thu Jan 28 20:30:08 EST 1999 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>

	  from the main Citadel tree, to pay attention to floor/room ordering

Thu Jan 14 17:14:11 EST 1999 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Modified the back end of mime_parser to use callbacks instead of
	  doing something specific.  Now we can use it elsewhere.

Mon Jan 11 21:53:16 EST 1999 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Fixed the bugs in "Site-wide configuration"
	* Added a "generic server commands" screen

	* Added an "edit your session" screen to change your wholisting.

Sun Jan  3 20:05:31 EST 1999 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Added "enter registration"
	* Set up automatic trigger of Enter Registration when the server
	  says it's needed
	* Established that a one-to-one WebCit/Citadel correspondence will
	  be required.  No big deal due to shared code segments.
	* Added "change password"
	* Added networking configuration screens.  These still need testing.
	* Added a "kill session" link to each line of the wholist when
	  logged in as an aide, and the screens to perform this operation.

Thu Dec 31 21:53:20 EST 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Final cvs commit for 1998 (an awful year, I'm glad to see it over).

	* context_loop.c: Moved "remove session" into its own function.
	  Check for dead webcit child process before each transaction.
	* Ignore SIGPIPE; this seems to magically make the program bulletproof
	  against broken HTTP connections.
	* Added a housekeeping thread to periodically remove dead sessions
	  and kill idle sessions.
	* messages.c: added "delete message" functionality
	* messages.c: added "move message" functionality

	  so when the parent process closes it, it actually _does_ close.
	  Otherwise, aIEeeee and possibly other browsers will hang.
	* Added support for graphics images retrieved from the Citadel server.
	* Set up login banner graphic and background image graphic

1998-12-09 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>

Tue Dec  8 15:45:42 EST 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Discovered that the HTTP socket problem is related to a socket that
	  isn't properly lingering on close.  Temporarily hacked a sleep(10)
	  into context_loop.c until it is figured out.

Mon Dec  7 17:03:18 EST 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Did a little debugging, still trying to figure out why logging in
	  displays "Connection reset by peer" error.  It used to work...

1998-12-07 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
