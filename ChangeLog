	* context_loop.c: Moved "remove session" into its own function.
	  Check for dead webcit child process before each transaction.
	* Ignore SIGPIPE; this seems to magically make the program bulletproof
	  against broken HTTP connections.
	* Added a housekeeping thread to periodically remove dead sessions
	  and kill idle sessions.
	* messages.c: added "delete message" functionality
	* messages.c: added "move message" functionality
	* userlist.c: added.  This adds "userlist" and "show user" functions.

	* Brought over message reading and entry functions from old WebCit

	* context_loop.c: really fix the SO_LINGER stuff
	* webserver.c: remove commented-out references to SO_LINGER

	* context_loop.c: After fork(), child process closes the HTTP socket
	  so when the parent process closes it, it actually _does_ close.
	  Otherwise, aIEeeee and possibly other browsers will hang.
	* Added support for graphics images retrieved from the Citadel server.
	* Set up login banner graphic and background image graphic

1998-12-09 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* context_loop.c, webserver.c, webserver.h: SO_LINGER and locking fix

	* Smoothed out some of the login/logout code.  Failed authentication
	  now works the way it should.
	* Added support for new user login (still need to handle registration).

Tue Dec  8 15:45:42 EST 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Discovered that the HTTP socket problem is related to a socket that
	  isn't properly lingering on close.  Temporarily hacked a sleep(10)
	  into context_loop.c until it is figured out.

Mon Dec  7 17:03:18 EST 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Did a little debugging, still trying to figure out why logging in
	  displays "Connection reset by peer" error.  It used to work...

1998-12-06 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* webserver.c: prototype vsnprintf
	* context_loop.c: warning fix

1998-12-05 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* tcp_sockets.c: removed some dead code
	* context_loop.c: oops, I made a memory leak. fix fix fix. also close
	  unused ends of pipes, fix a file descriptor leak and a race condition
	* portability enhancements

1998-12-04 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* webserver.c, context_loop.c, webcit.c: add commandline args for host
	  and port
	* converted to autoconf and began port to Digital UNIX
	* warning fixes
	* context_loop.c: moved the monster 64k buffer array off the stack
	* tcp_sockets.c: getservbyname() doesn't set errno.

1998-12-03 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* webserver.c: warning fix
