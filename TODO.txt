 1. aIEeeeeee 3.02 doesn't understand the HTTP "Window-target:" directive.  As
usual, Micro$oft was more concerned with protecting and extending monopolies
than with designing a good product.  As a result, "auto read new" when you
goto a new room causes the messages to show up in the room banner frame.  
   The easiest fix would probably be to detect IE <4.0 and disable the
auto-read-new function.
