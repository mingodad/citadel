A list of things I want to do before merging into trunk:

IMMEDIATE: 
* When a user resizes the mailbox view, save the positions to cookies and 
reload them on subsequent views. (deferred until some stylesheet revisions are done)

NICE TO HAVE:

* Drop down menu for bulk message ops

* Allow detatchable message view

* In-window message move for preview-pane (i.e browser won't navigate to confirm_message_move, we will pop up an artificial window)

DONE:

* 'Safe mode', because Internet Exploder and older PC's don't like rendering tables with lots of rows (say several thousand)
- Would limit number of messages shown to 500 at a time, user would select 'pages' like bbsview
- No client side sorting, sort calls get done by server

* Finish iconbar stuff, namely do the stylesheets for no-icons and no-text and the preference backend for them

* Fix iconbar roomlist ordering

DEFERRED:
I will wait until the bulk of the work is being used in the wild before attempting these: 
* Dual client-side and server-side search:
- Client searches for message subjects containing the search term, calls server for full text
* Further pagesize reduction: do compacting of scripts on "make install"

Any comments to the CitDev room or to me <matt@mcbridematt.dhs.org> / <matt@comalies>
