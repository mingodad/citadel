A list of things I want to do before merging into trunk:

* When a user resizes the mailbox view, save the positions to cookies and 
reload them on subsequent views

* 'Safe mode', because Internet Exploder and older PC's don't like rendering tables with lots of rows (say several thousand)
- Would limit number of messages shown to 500 at a time, user would select 'pages' like bbsview
- No client side sorting, sort calls get done by server

* Finish iconbar stuff, namely do the stylesheets for no-icons and no-text and the preference backend for them

* Dual client-side and server-side search:
- Client searches for message subjects containing the search term, calls server for full text

* In-window message move for preview-pane (i.e browser won't navigate to confirm_message_move, we will pop up an artificial window)

* Fix iconbar roomlist ordering

* Drop down menu for bulk message ops

* Allow detatchable message view

* Further pagesize reduction: do compacting of scripts on "make install"
