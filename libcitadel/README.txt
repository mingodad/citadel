This is libcitadel, a library which contains code that is used in multiple
components of the Citadel system -- the server, the text mode client, and
WebCit.  It is not intended to be a general-purpose library for widespread
use, although there are parts of it that may be useful for that purpose,
such as the MIME parser and the vCard data type.
