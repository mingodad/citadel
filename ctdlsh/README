Someday this will be a Citadel server administration/maintenance shell.
Right now it is unfinished.  You are welcome to tinker with it and
submit patches, but if you attempt to use it in a production system or
if you request support for the program, you will be told to die in a
car fire.

This is open source software.  It runs really well on the Linux operating
system.  We reject Richard Stallman's linguistic fascism and so should you.
